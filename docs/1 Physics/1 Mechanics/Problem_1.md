# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection
## Introduction
Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics. This report investigates how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection.

## Theoretical Foundation
In the foundation of projectile movement lie the Laws of Newton:

### First Law
An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. In terms of projectile motion, this means that once an object is in motion (like a ball thrown in the air), it will keep moving at a constant velocity in a straight line unless a force (like gravity or air resistance) acts on it.

### Second Law
This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass: 

$F=ma$ 

Where:

* F is the net force 
* m is the mass of the object
* a is the acceleration

In projectile motion, gravity provides a constant downward force that accelerates the object downward at a rate of approximately 
$9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ (on Earth).

### Third Law

This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In projectile motion, this law isn't as directly involved in the motion of the object but can be observed in other interactions.

### Motion Components
**Horizontal Motion**: The object moves horizontally with a constant velocity (since there is no force acting horizontally, assuming no air resistance).

**Vertical Motion**: The object moves vertically with constant acceleration due to gravity, starting with an initial velocity in the upward direction (if thrown upward) or zero velocity (if dropped).

### Main formulas:

* $x(t) = v_0\cos(θ)t$ - horizontal displacement
* $y(t) = v_0\sin(θ)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$ - vertical displacement

From the two formulas a single formula for the distance can be derived:

* $R = \frac{v_0^2\sin(2θ)}{g}$ - range formula for ideal conditions

## Analyzing the Range with regard to Angle

To analyze, at what angle does the object cross the largest distance, one can calculate the Range for different angles.

Let's take the angles $30°, 45°$ and $60°$
