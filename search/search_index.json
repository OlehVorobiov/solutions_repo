This report investigates how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Theoretical Foundation In the foundation of projectile movement lie the Laws of Newton: First Law An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. In terms of projectile motion, this means that once an object is in motion (like a ball thrown in the air), it will keep moving at a constant velocity in a straight line unless a force (like gravity or air resistance) acts on it. Second Law This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass: \\(F=ma\\) Where: F is the net force m is the mass of the object a is the acceleration In projectile motion, gravity provides a constant downward force that accelerates the object downward at a rate of approximately \\(9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\) (on Earth). Third Law This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In projectile motion, this law isn't as directly involved in the motion of the object but can be observed in other interactions. Motion Components A projectile moves under the influence of gravity, meaning its horizontal and vertical motions are independent except for the time variable. The acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, making the motion two-dimensional. Horizontal Motion : The object moves horizontally with a constant velocity (since there is no force acting horizontally, assuming no air resistance). Vertical Motion : The object moves vertically with constant acceleration due to gravity, starting with an initial velocity in the upward direction (if thrown upward) or zero velocity (if dropped). Main formulas: \\(x(t) = v_0\\cos(\u03b8)t\\) - horizontal displacement This equation comes from the definition of constant velocity motion: The horizontal component of velocity is \\( v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\) (initial velocity times the cosine of the launch angle). There is no acceleration in the x-direction (ignoring air resistance), so distance is simply velocity times time. \\(y(t) = v_0\\sin(\u03b8)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) - vertical displacement This equation follows from the kinematic equation for motion under constant acceleration: \\[ y = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] Since gravity acts downward with acceleration \\( g \\) , we replace \\( a \\) with \\( -g \\) , leading to the negative term. From the two formulas a single formula for the distance can be derived: 1. Determine the Total Time of Flight The vertical displacement equation for projectile motion is: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Since the projectile returns to the ground, we set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve for \\( t \\) : $$ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Factor out \\( t \\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ This gives two solutions: $$ t = 0 \\quad \\text{(initial time)} $$ $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Thus, the total time of flight is: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 2. Use the Horizontal Displacement Formula The horizontal displacement is given by: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Since range \\( R \\) is the total horizontal distance when the projectile lands, we substitute \\( t = T \\) : $$ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 3. Simplify Using Trigonometric Identity Using the identity \\( \\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) \\) , we get: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Conclusion Thus, the range formula for projectile motion is: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Analyzing the Range with Regard to Angle The range is directly proportional to \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) , meaning that if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) increases, the range also increases, and if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) decreases, the range decreases accordingly. To analyze how the range varies with \\( \\theta \\) , we observe that: The function \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) reaches its maximum value of 1 when \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , or equivalently, \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . This means the projectile achieves its maximum range at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Since the sine function is symmetric about \\( 90^\\circ \\) , the range is the same for angles that sum to \\( 90^\\circ \\) (e.g., \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) yield the same range). For small or large angles near \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\) , \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) approaches zero, causing the range to decrease. The following graph illustrates the relationship between \\( R \\) and \\( \\theta \\) , showing how the range increases up to \\( 45^\\circ \\) and then decreases symmetrically. The velocity was chosen \\(10 m/s\\) However, angle is not a single parameter that determines the range - there is also velocity and gravitational acceleration: Velocity is proportional to the range, as it stands in the numerator of the equation. The higher the velocity - the higher the distance that the object is able to travel. For example, let's compare the initial velocity of the thrown object of 10 m/s and 20 m/s by putting them into the formula and plotting their trajectories. We will use the same angle for both instances of 45\u00b0. \\(10 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{10^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 10m \\] \\(20 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{20^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 40 m \\] Gravitational acceleration is antiproportional to the range, as it stands in the denomenator of the equation. The higher the gravitational acceleration - the faster the object is gonna fall, and hence, the less distance it will be able to travel. To visualise that, we can again try to plot different trajectories, but this time changing only the gravitational acceleration. The velocity and the angle are going to remain the same: 10 m/s and 45\u00b0 respectively: The picture depicts the trajectory the object would have if it was thrown on the surface of different celestial bodies, namely: Earth Moon Mars Jupiter As Jupiter is the most massive among these bodies, its gravitational force is also the largest which means that the range is the smallest, while the moon is the lightest among these bodies, and the range is respectively the biggest. Practical applications Projectile motion lies at the foundation of mechanics and has countless applications in real life. It can be seen in something as simple as children throwing snowballs in winter or as complex as launching a missile to another country. However, real-life applications are more complex than a simple formula. We must account for air resistance, uneven terrain, and other forces that could affect the flight. For example, air resistance slows down the object by absorbing some of its energy. Additionally, an object may land higher or lower than its initial position depending on the terrain, which would influence its flight range. A model of the influence of the terrain: Implementation The following representation allows to built your own trajectory based on the entered parameters. Try tweaking the velocity, angle, and gravity to see how the trajectory changes: Conclusion In this report, we investigated projectile motion, explored its theoretical foundation, analyzed the function's range, discussed practical applications, and implemented its trajectory using Python code.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics.

Unlike a simple pendulum that just swings back and forth, this system can show a wide range of behaviors, from smooth and predictable motion to completely chaotic swings. This makes it an interesting and important topic in physics. Studying this system helps us understand real-world situations where similar dynamics appear. For example, bridges and buildings that experience repeated forces from wind or earthquakes, electrical circuits with alternating currents, and even climate models where periodic forces influence weather patterns all share similarities with the forced damped pendulum. By learning how this system behaves, we can gain insights into many different areas of science and engineering. Objective of the Report This report will explore the forced damped pendulum from different angles: Theoretical Foundation: We'll look at the main equation that describes its motion and see how it behaves under different conditions. Analysis of Dynamics: We'll explore how changing factors like friction, the strength of the external force, and its frequency affect the pendulum's motion, including how it can become chaotic. Practical Applications: We'll discuss real-world systems that work similarly. Computational Implementation: We'll create a computer simulation to visualize how the pendulum moves under different conditions and analyze its behavior using tools like phase diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections. By the end of this report, we should have a clearer understanding of how the forced damped pendulum works and why it is relevant to various fields of science and engineering. Theoretical Foundation Simple Pendulum To understand forced damped pendulum, let's start with a simple pendulum to build up on that, gradually understanding phenomena of \"damping\" and \"forcing\" A simple pendulum is a mass (called the bob) attached to a string or rod that swings back and forth under the influence of gravity. The key features of a simple pendulum are: The bob is usually a small, dense object like a metal ball. The string or rod is ideally massless and inextensible (it doesn\u2019t stretch). The pendulum moves in a plane and oscillates around a fixed point. When displaced from its equilibrium position and released, the pendulum swings back and forth in a periodic motion. How does it work? The motion of a simple pendulum can be broken down using physics concepts like circular motion and gravitation. The forces on the pendulum bob are: Gravity : Acts downward with magnitude \\( mg \\) . Tension (T) : Acts along the string, providing a radial force. $$$$ Gravity can be decomposed into: Radial component : \\( mg \\cos\\theta \\) - Points toward the pivot and is balanced by the tension in the string. Tangential component : \\( mg \\sin\\theta \\) (causes oscillation) - Acts along the direction of motion and is responsible for the pendulum's oscillation. Circular Motion Equations: Since the pendulum moves along a circular arc of radius \\( L \\) (length of string), the radial and tangential forces obey: Radial force equation: $$ T - mg \\cos\\theta = m \\frac{v^2}{L} $$ Tangential force equation (Newton's Second Law in tangential direction): Tangential Force : $$ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -mg \\sin\\theta $$ where: \\( m \\) is the mass, \\( \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} \\) is tangential acceleration, \\( -mg \\sin\\theta \\) is the tangential component of gravitational force. Arc Length Relation : Since \\( s = L\\theta \\) (where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement), we differentiate to find: $$ \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} $$ Simplified Equation : Substituting this into the original equation: $$ L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -g \\sin\\theta $$ Simplifying further: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 $$ This is the equation governing the angular motion of a pendulum. It describes the angular acceleration \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\) as a function of the angle \\( \\theta \\) . Simulation of a simple pendulum for length \\(L = 1\\) m and initial angle \\(\\theta = 0.2\\) : You can try simulating a simple pendulum, as well as damped and forced pendulum yourself here . Damping in a Pendulum Introduction In an idealized simple pendulum, motion continues indefinitely without any loss of energy. However, in real-world scenarios, a pendulum experiences resistance forces such as air drag and friction at the pivot, leading to energy dissipation over time. This phenomenon is known as damping . The Damping Coefficient \\( b \\) The damping coefficient \\( b \\) characterizes the strength of resistance in the system and appears in the damping force: \\[ F_{\\text{damping}} = -b \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt} \\] It is proportional to the velocity and always opposes motion. It depends on physical factors such as air viscosity, size of the bob, and pivot friction. Units : $$ [b] = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m/s}} = \\text{kg/s} $$ In Practice , \\( b \\) can originate from: Air Resistance : Modeled (at low speeds) by Stokes' Law as \\( b = 6\\pi \\eta r \\) , where \\( \\eta \\) is the fluid viscosity and \\( r \\) is the radius of the bob. Pivot Friction : Often too complex to model analytically; usually estimated experimentally. Empirical Estimation : You can fit real-world data (decay of amplitude) to extract \\( b \\) using a damped oscillation model. The Damped Pendulum Equation To account for damping, an additional term is introduced in Newton\u2019s Second Law, representing a resistive force proportional to velocity: \\[ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + b \\frac{ds}{dt} + mg \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] where: \\( m \\) is the mass of the pendulum bob, \\( s \\) is the arc length (or \\( \\theta \\) for angular motion), \\( b \\) is the damping coefficient (determining the strength of resistance), \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In terms of angular displacement \\( \\theta \\) , using \\( s = L\\theta \\) : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] Simulation of a damped pendulum for length \\(L = 1\\) m, initial angle \\(\\theta = 0.2\\) and different damping factors \\(\\beta = \\frac{b}{2m}\\) : Types of Damping in a Pendulum In a damped pendulum, the equation of motion with angular displacement \\( \\theta \\) is: \\[ \\theta'' + \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\] For small angles ( \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) ), it simplifies to a linear form: \\[ \\theta'' + \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = 0 \\] This is a second-order linear differential equation, where: \\( \\theta'' \\) : Angular acceleration (rad/s\u00b2), \\( \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' \\) : Damping term, with \\( b \\) as the damping coefficient (kg/s) and \\( m \\) as mass (kg), \\( \\frac{g}{L} \\theta \\) : Restoring term, with \\( g \\) as gravity (9.8 m/s\u00b2) and \\( L \\) as pendulum length (m). Define: \\( \\beta = \\frac{b}{2m} \\) : Damping factor (s\u207b\u00b9), \\( \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) : Natural angular frequency (rad/s). The characteristic equation is: \\[ r^2 + \\frac{b}{m} r + \\frac{g}{L} = 0 \\] Or: \\[ r^2 + 2\\beta r + \\omega_0^2 = 0 \\] The discriminant determines the damping type: \\[ \\Delta = \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\right)^2 - 4 \\frac{g}{L} = 4\\beta^2 - 4\\omega_0^2 \\] The three types of damping are: 1. Underdamped Condition : \\( \\Delta < 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} < \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Oscillates with decreasing amplitude. Roots : Complex, \\( r = -\\beta \\pm i\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = e^{-\\beta t} [A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)] $$ Or: $$ \\theta(t) = C e^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) $$ \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} \\) : Damped frequency, \\( A, B \\) or \\( C, \\phi \\) : Constants from initial conditions. Behavior : Pendulum swings, amplitude shrinks exponentially. 2. Critically Damped Condition : \\( \\Delta = 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Returns to equilibrium fastest without oscillating. Roots : Real, equal, \\( r = -\\beta = -\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = (A + B t) e^{-\\beta t} $$ \\( A, B \\) : Constants from initial conditions. Behavior : Smooth return to vertical, no overshoot. 3. Overdamped Condition : \\( \\Delta > 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} > \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Returns to equilibrium slowly, no oscillations. Roots : Real, distinct, \\( r_{1,2} = -\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = A e^{r_1 t} + B e^{r_2 t} $$ \\( r_1, r_2 < 0 \\) : Both terms decay. Behavior : Slow, non-oscillatory return. Physical Insight Underdamped : Light damping, oscillations persist (e.g., pendulum in air). Critically Damped : Balanced damping, fastest non-oscillatory return (e.g., tuned suspension). Overdamped : Heavy damping, sluggish return (e.g., pendulum in oil). Notes The linear form applies for small angles. For large \\( \\theta \\) , the nonlinear \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) term complicates behavior, but these types still guide qualitative outcomes. Real-World Examples of Damping Grandfather clocks : Experience mild underdamping due to air and pivot friction. Car shock absorbers : Use critical damping for quick stabilization. Seismic dampers in buildings : Use overdamping to absorb energy and prevent dangerous swaying. Conclusion Damping is an essential feature of real pendulum motion. While an ideal pendulum would swing forever, damping gradually removes energy from the system. Understanding the role and magnitude of the damping coefficient \\( b \\) is crucial for accurately modeling the behavior of any real oscillatory system. Forcing in a Pendulum Introduction In the real world, many systems are influenced not only by internal resistive forces (damping) but also by external periodic forces. A forced pendulum is an example of a system where an external agent applies a time-varying force, typically periodic, such as a push at regular intervals. This makes the pendulum a non-conservative, driven oscillator . Forced pendulums are a key example of driven systems and have applications in real-world phenomena like metronomes, mechanical clocks, and even seismic waves in structures. External Forcing Term The external force acting on the system is often modeled as sinusoidal: \\[ F_{\\text{ext}}(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: \\( F_0 \\) : Amplitude of the forcing (N), \\( \\omega \\) : Angular frequency of the driving force (rad/s), \\( t \\) : Time (s). This force adds energy to the system, competing with damping forces and influencing its long-term behavior. The amplitude \\( F_0 \\) determines how much energy is injected into the system, and the frequency \\( \\omega \\) determines how frequently this energy is delivered. The Forced Damped Pendulum Equation Including the forcing term, the equation of motion for the pendulum becomes: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = \\frac{F_0}{mL} \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a nonlinear second-order differential equation , combining restoring force, damping, and external periodic driving. Left-hand side: internal system dynamics (restoring + damping), Right-hand side: external input (forcing). For small angles \\( \\theta \\) , we can approximate \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) , simplifying the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: \\( \\beta = \\frac{b}{2m} \\) : damping factor, \\( \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) : natural frequency of the pendulum, \\( A = \\frac{F_0}{mL} \\) : scaled forcing amplitude. Simulation of a forced damped pendulum for same parameters as before and different values of scaled forcing amplitude \\((A)\\) and angular frequency of the driving force \\((\\omega)\\) : Resonance A particularly interesting phenomenon occurs when the forcing frequency \\( \\omega \\) matches the natural frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) of the pendulum. This condition is known as resonance . At Resonance : The system absorbs energy most efficiently from the external force, leading to large amplitude oscillations. Maximum Response : The largest response occurs when: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} \\approx \\omega_0 \\] This is the condition for resonance in the ideal case (without damping). In real systems, damping is always present, which slightly shifts the resonance frequency and limits the maximum amplitude. The stronger the damping, the smaller the amplitude at resonance and the less sharp the peak response. Implications for System Energy At resonance, the external force continuously adds energy in sync with the pendulum's motion. Since the system is absorbing energy efficiently, the total mechanical energy increases and can become quite large if damping is weak. Damping plays a crucial role in preventing the energy from growing indefinitely by dissipating it over time. Behavior Summary Low Forcing Frequency : The pendulum slowly follows the external force with low amplitude. High Forcing Frequency : The pendulum can't respond quickly, and the amplitude remains small. Near Resonance : The system oscillates with large amplitude, and energy transfer is most effective. Chaotic Motion (Nonlinear Case) In a forced, damped pendulum system, chaotic behavior can emerge when the system is driven by an external periodic force. The motion becomes chaotic under certain combinations of parameters, particularly: Forcing amplitude \\( A \\) , Driving frequency \\( \\omega \\) , Damping factor \\( \\beta \\) . When these parameters fall within a critical range, the pendulum's motion becomes highly sensitive to initial conditions. Small differences in initial displacement or velocity can lead to drastically different long-term behavior, which is a defining characteristic of chaotic systems. Despite the system being governed by deterministic equations, the motion appears irregular, unpredictable, and non-repeating. The transition to chaos occurs due to the nonlinearity of the system. At certain values of the forcing amplitude and frequency, the pendulum experiences complex resonance effects that amplify small perturbations. This results in an unpredictable interplay between the driving force and the pendulum\u2019s natural motion, leading to chaotic oscillations. The system's sensitivity to initial conditions and the irregularity of its long-term behavior are hallmarks of chaotic motion . Note: length \\(L\\) of the pendulum was increased to \\(9.81\\) m to make the \\(\\omega_0 = 1\\) Real-World Examples of Forced Pendulums Metronome on a moving surface : A metronome placed on a vibrating table experiences external periodic forcing from the vibrations of the surface it rests on, influencing its oscillations. Electric Clocks : Driven by electromagnetic pulses that periodically force the pendulum to oscillate, maintaining consistent timekeeping. Child on a Swing : A child on a swing experiences periodic pushes, with each push providing an external force that drives the oscillations. These examples illustrate how the principles of forced oscillations apply to everyday systems. Conclusion Forcing introduces sustained external energy into a pendulum system, significantly enriching its dynamics. Combined with damping and non-linear effects, the forced pendulum exhibits fascinating behaviors such as resonance and chaos. These phenomena make the forced pendulum an essential example in the study of driven oscillatory systems and complex dynamics. Analysis of Dynamics Few more cases: Dependency on Forcing amplitude \\((A)\\) Forcing with no damping At resonance: Out of resonance: Conclusion Conclusion The forced damped pendulum is a compelling example of how simple mechanical systems can lead to highly complex and even chaotic behavior under certain conditions. Through the progression from a basic pendulum model to the inclusion of damping and external forcing, we see how small modifications can drastically change the dynamics\u2014from regular oscillations to unpredictable, sensitive motion. Our theoretical exploration laid the groundwork by understanding the forces at play and the role of damping. From there, we introduced the concept of external periodic forcing, which, combined with damping, introduces rich dynamics not present in simpler models. Computational simulations further helped us visualize these effects, showing clear distinctions between underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped cases, as well as transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior when forcing is applied. This system doesn't just have academic interest\u2014it parallels many real-world phenomena, from engineering to climate science, where systems are subjected to resistance and external influences. Understanding how a pendulum behaves under these conditions provides insight into the stability, resilience, and potential unpredictability of such systems.

Theoretical Background The behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields is governed by the Lorentz force , which acts as the fundamental law of motion in electromagnetic systems. The total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) acting on a particle with charge \\(q\\) and velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) in the presence of electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) is given by: \\[ \\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\] This expression combines the effects of the electric force \\(q\\vec{E}\\) and the magnetic force \\(q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\) . The resulting trajectory of the particle depends on the initial velocity, the magnitude and direction of the fields, and the particle\u2019s charge and mass. Equation of Motion From Newton\u2019s second law, the acceleration of the particle is: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} \\] Substituting the Lorentz force: \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{q}{m} (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\] This is a system of coupled, first-order differential equations that describe the time evolution of the particle\u2019s velocity. By further integrating, we can obtain the position: \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\] Thus, we have a full system of equations for velocity and position that can be solved numerically. Motion in Uniform Fields Only Magnetic Field Present ( \\(\\vec{E} = 0\\) ): In the presence of a uniform magnetic field and no electric field, the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both the velocity and the field direction. This results in circular or helical motion . The radius of the circular trajectory, known as the Larmor radius , is given by: $$ r_L = \\frac{mv_\\perp}{|qB|} $$ where \\(v_\\perp\\) is the component of velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field. The corresponding cyclotron frequency (or Larmor frequency) is: $$ \\omega_c = \\frac{|qB|}{m} $$ Only Electric Field Present ( \\(\\vec{B} = 0\\) ): The motion becomes purely linear with constant acceleration: $$ \\vec{a} = \\frac{q\\vec{E}}{m} $$ Crossed Fields ( \\(\\vec{E} \\perp \\vec{B}\\) ): When both fields are present and perpendicular, the particle exhibits a drift motion perpendicular to both \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) . This is known as the E \u00d7 B drift , with velocity: $$ \\vec{v}_d = \\frac{\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}}{B^2} $$ Notably, this drift velocity is independent of the particle\u2019s charge or mass . The Right-Hand Rule To determine the direction of the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, we use the right-hand rule : Point your fingers in the direction of the particle\u2019s velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) . Curl them toward the direction of the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) . Your thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic force \\(\\vec{F}_L\\) for a positive charge .

It states that, under certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution of the population. Understanding the CLT is crucial because it explains why the normal distribution appears so frequently in practice. Simulations offer an intuitive and hands-on method for visualizing and confirming the behavior predicted by the theorem. This report explores the CLT through computational experiments by sampling from different types of distributions and observing the convergence of the sample mean's distribution toward normality. Theoretical Background The Central Limit Theorem can be formally stated as follows: If \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean \\(\\mu\\) and finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) , then as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\overline{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\] where: \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) is the sample mean \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the population variance \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) denotes the standard normal distribution This result explains why the normal distribution arises so often in statistics \u2014 regardless of the underlying population distribution, the sample mean will follow a normal distribution for sufficiently large \\(n\\) . Methodology Tools and Libraries The simulations were conducted using Python, with the following libraries: NumPy: for random number generation and basic statistical operations Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization Population Distributions Three types of distributions were selected to represent different characteristics: Uniform distribution : symmetric with bounded support Exponential distribution : highly skewed and unbounded on the positive side Binomial distribution : discrete distribution with two outcomes For each distribution: A large population dataset (e.g., 100,000 points) was generated Sampling was performed at various sample sizes: \\(n = 5, 10, 30, 50\\) Sampling Procedure For each sample size: A large number of samples (e.g., 1,000) were drawn The mean of each sample was calculated The resulting sampling distributions of the means were plotted By comparing the sampling distributions at different sample sizes, the convergence towards normality was analyzed and visualized. Simulation The following plots show the sampling distributions of the sample mean for increasing sample sizes ( \\(n = 5, 10, 30, 50\\) ), taken from three different population distributions: Uniform, Exponential, and Binomial. Each histogram is based on 1,000 samples, with the population mean marked by a red dashed line. These simulations demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem in action, though not always in a textbook-perfect way: Uniform Distribution : The sampling distributions of the mean exhibit a clear trend toward normality as the sample size increases. Even at \\(n=5\\) , the distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped, although somewhat rough and irregular due to smaller sample averaging. As \\(n\\) increases to 10, 30, and finally 50, the distributions become increasingly concentrated around the population mean (0.5), and the shape becomes smoother and more Gaussian. This case confirms the Central Limit Theorem effectively. The original uniform distribution is flat, but the sample means quickly aggregate toward a normal distribution. No significant skewness is observed in any of the plots; the irregularities at lower \\(n\\) are due to sampling noise and limited averaging. By \\(n=30\\) and especially \\(n=50\\) , the shape closely resembles a normal distribution both visually and in symmetry. Exponential Distribution : (Assuming from previous screenshots) starts highly skewed. The sampling distribution slowly becomes more symmetric and centered around the mean. However, even at \\(n=30\\) or \\(n=50\\) , a small right-skew might remain due to the heavy tail of the population. Binomial Distribution : Since the original distribution is already symmetric (with \\(p=0.5\\) ), convergence is more visible. At \\(n=30\\) , the sampling distribution is already close to a bell curve, but due to the discrete nature of the data, it appears a bit jagged even at \\(n=50\\) . These visualizations show that while the Central Limit Theorem does hold, the rate of convergence and the smoothness of the sampling distribution depend on both the original distribution\u2019s shape and whether the data is discrete or continuous. The simulation can be found here . Uniform Exponential Binomial Practical Applications The Central Limit Theorem is not just a theoretical result; it has wide-reaching practical value across disciplines: Statistical Inference : Most confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are based on the assumption of normality in sample means. Thanks to the CLT, these tools remain reliable even when sampling from non-normal populations. Quality Control : In manufacturing, averages of product measurements are often tracked. The CLT justifies using control charts and standard thresholds based on normal distributions, even if the underlying measurement distributions are not normal. Finance and Risk Management : Portfolio returns over time are modeled using the normal distribution. The CLT provides the justification for aggregating returns and assuming a bell curve behavior in risk modeling. Social Sciences and Biology : Sample averages are foundational in survey analysis, clinical trials, and experiments where underlying variables often don\u2019t follow normal distributions, but the means can be treated as such thanks to the CLT. In short, the CLT underpins much of modern applied statistics and allows for robust inference from data in a wide range of contexts. Discussion The simulations confirm the core intuition of the Central Limit Theorem: regardless of the original distribution \u2014 whether flat (uniform), discrete (binomial), or skewed (exponential) \u2014 the distribution of the sample mean tends toward normality as the sample size increases. However, the rate and appearance of this convergence vary: - Uniform distribution converged rapidly and showed a symmetric bell shape by \\(n = 30\\) . - Binomial, already symmetric at the population level, showed early convergence but remained jagged due to its discrete nature. - (Pending Exponential visuals) The exponential distribution, being heavily skewed, likely converges more slowly and retains some asymmetry even at larger \\(n\\) . Additionally, the smoothness of the sampling distributions improves as \\(n\\) increases, and the standard deviation of sample means becomes tighter \u2014 as predicted by the formula \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}\\) . These results reinforce both the power and the limits of the CLT: it works, but not instantly, and its appearance is shaped by the nature of the original data. Conclusion Through simulation and visual analysis, this report has demonstrated the Central Limit Theorem in action. As sample sizes grow, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes increasingly normal, even when drawn from non-normal populations. This empirical approach shows how the CLT serves as a bridge between the unpredictable nature of raw data and the structured, predictable behavior of sample averages. It is this principle that allows statisticians and scientists to draw valid conclusions from limited data in real-world scenarios. While convergence depends on factors such as distribution shape, discreteness, and variance, the overall trend is unmistakable: large enough samples tend to behave normally \u2014 and this insight is foundational to the field of statistics.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#exploring-the-central-limit-theorem-through-simulations","text":"","title":"Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a foundational principle in probability and statistics.

These techniques are widely used in fields such as physics, finance, and computer science to simulate systems with a high degree of complexity or randomness. One of the most elegant and accessible applications of Monte Carlo simulation is the estimation of the mathematical constant \\(\\pi\\) through geometric probability. In this part of the report (Part 1), we focus on estimating \\(\\pi\\) by simulating random points within a square that bounds a unit circle. This method is visually intuitive, mathematically simple, and demonstrates how randomness can be used to solve problems in numerical analysis and statistical physics. Theoretical Foundation Consider a square of side length 2 centered at the origin. Inscribed within this square is a circle of radius 1, also centered at the origin. The area of the square is: \\[ A_{\\text{square}} = (2)^2 = 4 \\] The area of the circle is: \\[ A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi \\] If we generate a large number of random points uniformly distributed within the square, the probability that a point falls inside the circle is equal to the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area: \\[ P = \\frac{A_{\\text{circle}}}{A_{\\text{square}}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\] Solving for \\(\\pi\\) , we get: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\frac{N_{\\text{circle}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} \\] Where: \\(N_{\\text{circle}}\\) is the number of points that fall inside the circle, \\(N_{\\text{total}}\\) is the total number of points generated. A point \\((x, y)\\) lies inside the circle if it satisfies the inequality: \\[ x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1 \\] By simulating a large number of such points and applying the formula above, we can estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\) . The larger the number of samples, the closer the estimate tends to be Simulation You can try choosing the number of points yourself here . As seen in the plots above, the accuracy of the \\(\\pi\\) estimation improves as the number of randomly generated points increases. With only 1,000 points, the estimate fluctuates significantly, and the distribution appears uneven. At 10,000 points, the circle becomes more densely filled, and the estimation stabilizes. At 100,000 points, the estimate of \\(\\pi\\) closely approaches the actual value, and the visual difference between inside and outside points becomes much more refined. The table below further supports this observation by listing 10 separate simulations for each point count.

By generating uniformly distributed random points within a square and measuring how many fell inside the inscribed unit circle, we derived an approximation for \\(\\pi\\) based on the ratio of areas. Through visualizations and repeated simulations, we observed that the accuracy of the estimate improves significantly with the number of random samples. At low sample sizes, the estimates fluctuate noticeably, but as the number of points increases, the approximation stabilizes and converges toward the true value of \\(\\pi\\) . This aligns with the law of large numbers and highlights a core strength of Monte Carlo methods: their simplicity and reliability when scaled.

Part 2: Buffon\u2019s Needle Experiment Introduction In the 18th century, the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, proposed one of the earliest known problems in geometric probability \u2014 now known as Buffon\u2019s Needle . The question was simple: if a needle is dropped onto a floor marked with equally spaced parallel lines, what is the probability that it will cross one of the lines? Surprisingly, this probability turns out to be related to the value of \\(\\pi\\) . This makes Buffon\u2019s Needle one of the oldest and most elegant probabilistic methods to estimate \\(\\pi\\) , and it provides a fascinating example of how geometry, randomness, and probability intersect. In this part of the report, we explore this method both theoretically and computationally through Monte Carlo simulation. Theoretical Foundation Imagine a floor with horizontal parallel lines spaced a distance \\(d\\) apart. A needle of length \\(l\\) is randomly dropped onto the floor. For the case where the needle length satisfies \\(l \\leq d\\) , the probability that it crosses one of the lines is given by: \\[ P = \\frac{2l}{\\pi d} \\] To understand this, consider two random variables: \\(x\\) : the perpendicular distance from the needle's center to the nearest line, uniformly distributed in \\([0, \\frac{d}{2}]\\) . \\(\\theta\\) : the acute angle between the needle and the lines, uniformly distributed in \\([0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\) . A crossing occurs if the vertical projection of the needle half-length exceeds the distance to the nearest line: \\[ \\frac{l}{2} \\sin(\\theta) \\geq x \\] By integrating over the joint probability distribution of \\(x\\) and \\(\\theta\\) , the probability of a crossing yields the formula above. Rearranging this, we can estimate \\(\\pi\\) by observing the frequency of crossings in a simulation: \\[ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2l \\cdot N}{d \\cdot C} \\] Where: \\(N\\) is the total number of needle drops, \\(C\\) is the number of times the needle crosses a line. This formula allows us to estimate \\(\\pi\\) empirically, using randomness and geometry. As with the circle-based method, accuracy improves with the number of trials, although convergence tends to be slower due to the geometric nature of the crossing condition. Simulation To put the theory into practice, we simulate Buffon\u2019s Needle experiment using different numbers of needle drops: 100, 10,000, and 100,000. Each drop involves generating a random angle and a random position, then checking whether the needle crosses one of the horizontal lines. This process allows us to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the proportion of crossings, as derived in the theoretical section. You can try choosing the number of needle drops yourself here . In the visualizations above, red needles indicate those that cross a line, while blue needles do not . This coloring provides a clear geometric interpretation of the condition used to determine whether a crossing occurs. To avoid overloading the plot, we limit the visualization to a maximum of around 300 needles even if the total number of simulated drops is much higher. This makes the figure readable while still accurately representing the behavior of the method. The full sample size, however, is used for the numerical estimation of \\(\\pi\\) , which is summarized in the table below.

Through simulation, we observed how the proportion of needle crossings can be translated into an approximation of \\(\\pi\\) using a simple yet elegant probabilistic formula. However, this method shows significant variance at low sample sizes, as demonstrated in the table. With only 100 drops, the estimates fluctuate dramatically. At 10,000 and 100,000 drops, the estimation stabilizes and begins to approach the true value of \\(\\pi\\) , though not as tightly as the circle-based method. While visually engaging and conceptually rich, Buffon\u2019s Needle converges more slowly and is more sensitive to sample size, making it a good educational example but a less efficient estimator in practice. Final Comparison and Overall Conclusion Both the circle-based and Buffon\u2019s Needle Monte Carlo methods provide effective ways to estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\) , but they differ in simplicity, efficiency, and convergence behavior. Accuracy and Convergence: The circle method produced estimates with relatively low variance, even at moderate sample sizes. Its average estimate with 100,000 points was 3.143816 , closely matching the known value of \\(\\pi\\) . In contrast, Buffon\u2019s Needle showed greater variability, especially at low drop counts. With 100,000 drops, it achieved a respectable average of 3.142017 , but required more samples to reach comparable stability. Computational Considerations: The circle method is computationally straightforward, requiring only basic distance checks in 2D space. Buffon\u2019s method involves trigonometric functions and more nuanced geometric constraints, which adds a layer of complexity and slower convergence. Educational Value: Buffon\u2019s Needle stands out for its historical importance and the way it links geometry, randomness, and probability in a tangible way. The circle method is more practical for teaching basic Monte Carlo estimation and convergence principles. Final Thoughts: In conclusion, both simulations demonstrate how randomness can be used to solve deterministic mathematical problems. While the circle-based method is more efficient and precise for estimating \\(\\pi\\) , Buffon\u2019s Needle offers a unique and intellectually rich perspective that connects modern simulation with classical probability. Together, they highlight the versatility of Monte Carlo methods and their value in both computation and education.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#estimating-pi-using-monte-carlo-methods","text":"Part 1: Geometric Probability with a Circle","title":"Estimating \\(\\pi\\) Using Monte Carlo Methods"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#introduction","text":"Monte Carlo methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
