This report investigates how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Theoretical Foundation In the foundation of projectile movement lie the Laws of Newton: First Law An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. In terms of projectile motion, this means that once an object is in motion (like a ball thrown in the air), it will keep moving at a constant velocity in a straight line unless a force (like gravity or air resistance) acts on it. Second Law This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass: \\(F=ma\\) Where: F is the net force m is the mass of the object a is the acceleration In projectile motion, gravity provides a constant downward force that accelerates the object downward at a rate of approximately \\(9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\) (on Earth). Third Law This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In projectile motion, this law isn't as directly involved in the motion of the object but can be observed in other interactions. Motion Components A projectile moves under the influence of gravity, meaning its horizontal and vertical motions are independent except for the time variable. The acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, making the motion two-dimensional. Horizontal Motion : The object moves horizontally with a constant velocity (since there is no force acting horizontally, assuming no air resistance). Vertical Motion : The object moves vertically with constant acceleration due to gravity, starting with an initial velocity in the upward direction (if thrown upward) or zero velocity (if dropped). Main formulas: \\(x(t) = v_0\\cos(\u03b8)t\\) - horizontal displacement This equation comes from the definition of constant velocity motion: The horizontal component of velocity is \\( v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\) (initial velocity times the cosine of the launch angle). There is no acceleration in the x-direction (ignoring air resistance), so distance is simply velocity times time. \\(y(t) = v_0\\sin(\u03b8)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) - vertical displacement This equation follows from the kinematic equation for motion under constant acceleration: \\[ y = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] Since gravity acts downward with acceleration \\( g \\) , we replace \\( a \\) with \\( -g \\) , leading to the negative term. From the two formulas a single formula for the distance can be derived: 1. Determine the Total Time of Flight The vertical displacement equation for projectile motion is: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Since the projectile returns to the ground, we set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve for \\( t \\) : $$ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Factor out \\( t \\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ This gives two solutions: $$ t = 0 \\quad \\text{(initial time)} $$ $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Thus, the total time of flight is: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 2. Use the Horizontal Displacement Formula The horizontal displacement is given by: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Since range \\( R \\) is the total horizontal distance when the projectile lands, we substitute \\( t = T \\) : $$ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 3. Simplify Using Trigonometric Identity Using the identity \\( \\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) \\) , we get: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Conclusion Thus, the range formula for projectile motion is: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Analyzing the Range with Regard to Angle The range is directly proportional to \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) , meaning that if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) increases, the range also increases, and if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) decreases, the range decreases accordingly. To analyze how the range varies with \\( \\theta \\) , we observe that: The function \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) reaches its maximum value of 1 when \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , or equivalently, \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . This means the projectile achieves its maximum range at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Since the sine function is symmetric about \\( 90^\\circ \\) , the range is the same for angles that sum to \\( 90^\\circ \\) (e.g., \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) yield the same range). For small or large angles near \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\) , \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) approaches zero, causing the range to decrease. The following graph illustrates the relationship between \\( R \\) and \\( \\theta \\) , showing how the range increases up to \\( 45^\\circ \\) and then decreases symmetrically. The velocity was chosen \\(10 m/s\\) However, angle is not a single parameter that determines the range - there is also velocity and gravitational acceleration: Velocity is proportional to the range, as it stands in the numerator of the equation. The higher the velocity - the higher the distance that the object is able to travel. For example, let's compare the initial velocity of the thrown object of 10 m/s and 20 m/s by putting them into the formula and plotting their trajectories. We will use the same angle for both instances of 45\u00b0. \\(10 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{10^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 10m \\] \\(20 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{20^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 40 m \\] Gravitational acceleration is antiproportional to the range, as it stands in the denomenator of the equation. The higher the gravitational acceleration - the faster the object is gonna fall, and hence, the less distance it will be able to travel. To visualise that, we can again try to plot different trajectories, but this time changing only the gravitational acceleration. The velocity and the angle are going to remain the same: 10 m/s and 45\u00b0 respectively: The picture depicts the trajectory the object would have if it was thrown on the surface of different celestial bodies, namely: Earth Moon Mars Jupiter As Jupiter is the most massive among these bodies, its gravitational force is also the largest which means that the range is the smallest, while the moon is the lightest among these bodies, and the range is respectively the biggest. Practical applications Projectile motion lies at the foundation of mechanics and has countless applications in real life. It can be seen in something as simple as children throwing snowballs in winter or as complex as launching a missile to another country. However, real-life applications are more complex than a simple formula. We must account for air resistance, uneven terrain, and other forces that could affect the flight. For example, air resistance slows down the object by absorbing some of its energy. Additionally, an object may land higher or lower than its initial position depending on the terrain, which would influence its flight range. A model of the influence of the terrain: Implementation The following representation allows to built your own trajectory based on the entered parameters. Try tweaking the velocity, angle, and gravity to see how the trajectory changes: Conclusion In this report, we investigated projectile motion, explored its theoretical foundation, analyzed the function's range, discussed practical applications, and implemented its trajectory using Python code.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics.

Unlike a simple pendulum that just swings back and forth, this system can show a wide range of behaviors, from smooth and predictable motion to completely chaotic swings. This makes it an interesting and important topic in physics. Studying this system helps us understand real-world situations where similar dynamics appear. For example, bridges and buildings that experience repeated forces from wind or earthquakes, electrical circuits with alternating currents, and even climate models where periodic forces influence weather patterns all share similarities with the forced damped pendulum. By learning how this system behaves, we can gain insights into many different areas of science and engineering. Objective of the Report This report will explore the forced damped pendulum from different angles: Theoretical Foundation: We'll look at the main equation that describes its motion and see how it behaves under different conditions. Analysis of Dynamics: We'll explore how changing factors like friction, the strength of the external force, and its frequency affect the pendulum's motion, including how it can become chaotic. Practical Applications: We'll discuss real-world systems that work similarly. Computational Implementation: We'll create a computer simulation to visualize how the pendulum moves under different conditions and analyze its behavior using tools like phase diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections. By the end of this report, we should have a clearer understanding of how the forced damped pendulum works and why it is relevant to various fields of science and engineering. Theoretical Foundation Simple Pendulum To understand forced damped pendulum, let's start with a simple pendulum to build up on that, gradually understanding phenomena of \"damping\" and \"forcing\" A simple pendulum is a mass (called the bob) attached to a string or rod that swings back and forth under the influence of gravity. The key features of a simple pendulum are: The bob is usually a small, dense object like a metal ball. The string or rod is ideally massless and inextensible (it doesn\u2019t stretch). The pendulum moves in a plane and oscillates around a fixed point. When displaced from its equilibrium position and released, the pendulum swings back and forth in a periodic motion. How does it work? The motion of a simple pendulum can be broken down using physics concepts like circular motion and gravitation. The forces on the pendulum bob are: Gravity : Acts downward with magnitude \\( mg \\) . Tension (T) : Acts along the string, providing a radial force. $$$$ Gravity can be decomposed into: Radial component : \\( mg \\cos\\theta \\) - Points toward the pivot and is balanced by the tension in the string. Tangential component : \\( mg \\sin\\theta \\) (causes oscillation) - Acts along the direction of motion and is responsible for the pendulum's oscillation. Circular Motion Equations: Since the pendulum moves along a circular arc of radius \\( L \\) (length of string), the radial and tangential forces obey: Radial force equation: $$ T - mg \\cos\\theta = m \\frac{v^2}{L} $$ Tangential force equation (Newton's Second Law in tangential direction): Tangential Force : $$ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -mg \\sin\\theta $$ where: \\( m \\) is the mass, \\( \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} \\) is tangential acceleration, \\( -mg \\sin\\theta \\) is the tangential component of gravitational force. Arc Length Relation : Since \\( s = L\\theta \\) (where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement), we differentiate to find: $$ \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} $$ Simplified Equation : Substituting this into the original equation: $$ L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -g \\sin\\theta $$ Simplifying further: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 $$ This is the equation governing the angular motion of a pendulum. It describes the angular acceleration \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\) as a function of the angle \\( \\theta \\) . Simulation of a simple pendulum for length \\(L = 1\\) m and initial angle \\(\\theta = 0.2\\) : You can try simulating a simple pendulum, as well as damped and forced pendulum yourself here . Damping in a Pendulum Introduction In an idealized simple pendulum, motion continues indefinitely without any loss of energy. However, in real-world scenarios, a pendulum experiences resistance forces such as air drag and friction at the pivot, leading to energy dissipation over time. This phenomenon is known as damping . The Damping Coefficient \\( b \\) The damping coefficient \\( b \\) characterizes the strength of resistance in the system and appears in the damping force: \\[ F_{\\text{damping}} = -b \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt} \\] It is proportional to the velocity and always opposes motion. It depends on physical factors such as air viscosity, size of the bob, and pivot friction. Units : $$ [b] = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m/s}} = \\text{kg/s} $$ In Practice , \\( b \\) can originate from: Air Resistance : Modeled (at low speeds) by Stokes' Law as \\( b = 6\\pi \\eta r \\) , where \\( \\eta \\) is the fluid viscosity and \\( r \\) is the radius of the bob. Pivot Friction : Often too complex to model analytically; usually estimated experimentally. Empirical Estimation : You can fit real-world data (decay of amplitude) to extract \\( b \\) using a damped oscillation model. The Damped Pendulum Equation To account for damping, an additional term is introduced in Newton\u2019s Second Law, representing a resistive force proportional to velocity: \\[ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + b \\frac{ds}{dt} + mg \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] where: \\( m \\) is the mass of the pendulum bob, \\( s \\) is the arc length (or \\( \\theta \\) for angular motion), \\( b \\) is the damping coefficient (determining the strength of resistance), \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In terms of angular displacement \\( \\theta \\) , using \\( s = L\\theta \\) : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] Simulation of a damped pendulum for length \\(L = 1\\) m, initial angle \\(\\theta = 0.2\\) and different damping factors \\(\\beta = \\frac{b}{2m}\\) : Types of Damping in a Pendulum In a damped pendulum, the equation of motion with angular displacement \\( \\theta \\) is: \\[ \\theta'' + \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\] For small angles ( \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) ), it simplifies to a linear form: \\[ \\theta'' + \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = 0 \\] This is a second-order linear differential equation, where: \\( \\theta'' \\) : Angular acceleration (rad/s\u00b2), \\( \\frac{b}{m} \\theta' \\) : Damping term, with \\( b \\) as the damping coefficient (kg/s) and \\( m \\) as mass (kg), \\( \\frac{g}{L} \\theta \\) : Restoring term, with \\( g \\) as gravity (9.8 m/s\u00b2) and \\( L \\) as pendulum length (m). Define: \\( \\beta = \\frac{b}{2m} \\) : Damping factor (s\u207b\u00b9), \\( \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) : Natural angular frequency (rad/s). The characteristic equation is: \\[ r^2 + \\frac{b}{m} r + \\frac{g}{L} = 0 \\] Or: \\[ r^2 + 2\\beta r + \\omega_0^2 = 0 \\] The discriminant determines the damping type: \\[ \\Delta = \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\right)^2 - 4 \\frac{g}{L} = 4\\beta^2 - 4\\omega_0^2 \\] The three types of damping are: 1. Underdamped Condition : \\( \\Delta < 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} < \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Oscillates with decreasing amplitude. Roots : Complex, \\( r = -\\beta \\pm i\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = e^{-\\beta t} [A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)] $$ Or: $$ \\theta(t) = C e^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) $$ \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} \\) : Damped frequency, \\( A, B \\) or \\( C, \\phi \\) : Constants from initial conditions. Behavior : Pendulum swings, amplitude shrinks exponentially. 2. Critically Damped Condition : \\( \\Delta = 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Returns to equilibrium fastest without oscillating. Roots : Real, equal, \\( r = -\\beta = -\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = (A + B t) e^{-\\beta t} $$ \\( A, B \\) : Constants from initial conditions. Behavior : Smooth return to vertical, no overshoot. 3. Overdamped Condition : \\( \\Delta > 0 \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{2m} > \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) . Description : Returns to equilibrium slowly, no oscillations. Roots : Real, distinct, \\( r_{1,2} = -\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} \\) . Solution : $$ \\theta(t) = A e^{r_1 t} + B e^{r_2 t} $$ \\( r_1, r_2 < 0 \\) : Both terms decay. Behavior : Slow, non-oscillatory return. Physical Insight Underdamped : Light damping, oscillations persist (e.g., pendulum in air). Critically Damped : Balanced damping, fastest non-oscillatory return (e.g., tuned suspension). Overdamped : Heavy damping, sluggish return (e.g., pendulum in oil). Notes The linear form applies for small angles. For large \\( \\theta \\) , the nonlinear \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) term complicates behavior, but these types still guide qualitative outcomes. Real-World Examples of Damping Grandfather clocks : Experience mild underdamping due to air and pivot friction. Car shock absorbers : Use critical damping for quick stabilization. Seismic dampers in buildings : Use overdamping to absorb energy and prevent dangerous swaying. Conclusion Damping is an essential feature of real pendulum motion. While an ideal pendulum would swing forever, damping gradually removes energy from the system. Understanding the role and magnitude of the damping coefficient \\( b \\) is crucial for accurately modeling the behavior of any real oscillatory system. Forcing in a Pendulum Introduction In the real world, many systems are influenced not only by internal resistive forces (damping) but also by external periodic forces. A forced pendulum is an example of a system where an external agent applies a time-varying force, typically periodic, such as a push at regular intervals. This makes the pendulum a non-conservative, driven oscillator . Forced pendulums are a key example of driven systems and have applications in real-world phenomena like metronomes, mechanical clocks, and even seismic waves in structures. External Forcing Term The external force acting on the system is often modeled as sinusoidal: \\[ F_{\\text{ext}}(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: \\( F_0 \\) : Amplitude of the forcing (N), \\( \\omega \\) : Angular frequency of the driving force (rad/s), \\( t \\) : Time (s). This force adds energy to the system, competing with damping forces and influencing its long-term behavior. The amplitude \\( F_0 \\) determines how much energy is injected into the system, and the frequency \\( \\omega \\) determines how frequently this energy is delivered. The Forced Damped Pendulum Equation Including the forcing term, the equation of motion for the pendulum becomes: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = \\frac{F_0}{mL} \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a nonlinear second-order differential equation , combining restoring force, damping, and external periodic driving. Left-hand side: internal system dynamics (restoring + damping), Right-hand side: external input (forcing). For small angles \\( \\theta \\) , we can approximate \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) , simplifying the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: \\( \\beta = \\frac{b}{2m} \\) : damping factor, \\( \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\) : natural frequency of the pendulum, \\( A = \\frac{F_0}{mL} \\) : scaled forcing amplitude. Simulation of a forced damped pendulum for same parameters as before and different values of scaled forcing amplitude \\((A)\\) and angular frequency of the driving force \\((\\omega)\\) : Resonance A particularly interesting phenomenon occurs when the forcing frequency \\( \\omega \\) matches the natural frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) of the pendulum. This condition is known as resonance . At Resonance : The system absorbs energy most efficiently from the external force, leading to large amplitude oscillations. Maximum Response : The largest response occurs when: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} \\approx \\omega_0 \\] This is the condition for resonance in the ideal case (without damping). In real systems, damping is always present, which slightly shifts the resonance frequency and limits the maximum amplitude. The stronger the damping, the smaller the amplitude at resonance and the less sharp the peak response. Implications for System Energy At resonance, the external force continuously adds energy in sync with the pendulum's motion. Since the system is absorbing energy efficiently, the total mechanical energy increases and can become quite large if damping is weak. Damping plays a crucial role in preventing the energy from growing indefinitely by dissipating it over time. Behavior Summary Low Forcing Frequency : The pendulum slowly follows the external force with low amplitude. High Forcing Frequency : The pendulum can't respond quickly, and the amplitude remains small. Near Resonance : The system oscillates with large amplitude, and energy transfer is most effective. Chaotic Motion (Nonlinear Case) In a forced, damped pendulum system, chaotic behavior can emerge when the system is driven by an external periodic force. The motion becomes chaotic under certain combinations of parameters, particularly: Forcing amplitude \\( A \\) , Driving frequency \\( \\omega \\) , Damping factor \\( \\beta \\) . When these parameters fall within a critical range, the pendulum's motion becomes highly sensitive to initial conditions. Small differences in initial displacement or velocity can lead to drastically different long-term behavior, which is a defining characteristic of chaotic systems. Despite the system being governed by deterministic equations, the motion appears irregular, unpredictable, and non-repeating. The transition to chaos occurs due to the nonlinearity of the system. At certain values of the forcing amplitude and frequency, the pendulum experiences complex resonance effects that amplify small perturbations. This results in an unpredictable interplay between the driving force and the pendulum\u2019s natural motion, leading to chaotic oscillations. The system's sensitivity to initial conditions and the irregularity of its long-term behavior are hallmarks of chaotic motion . Note: length \\(L\\) of the pendulum was increased to \\(9.81\\) m to make the \\(\\omega_0 = 1\\) Real-World Examples of Forced Pendulums Metronome on a moving surface : A metronome placed on a vibrating table experiences external periodic forcing from the vibrations of the surface it rests on, influencing its oscillations. Electric Clocks : Driven by electromagnetic pulses that periodically force the pendulum to oscillate, maintaining consistent timekeeping. Child on a Swing : A child on a swing experiences periodic pushes, with each push providing an external force that drives the oscillations. These examples illustrate how the principles of forced oscillations apply to everyday systems. Conclusion Forcing introduces sustained external energy into a pendulum system, significantly enriching its dynamics. Combined with damping and non-linear effects, the forced pendulum exhibits fascinating behaviors such as resonance and chaos. These phenomena make the forced pendulum an essential example in the study of driven oscillatory systems and complex dynamics. Analysis of Dynamics Few more cases: Dependency on Forcing amplitude \\((A)\\) Forcing with no damping At resonance: Out of resonance: Conclusion Conclusion The forced damped pendulum is a compelling example of how simple mechanical systems can lead to highly complex and even chaotic behavior under certain conditions. Through the progression from a basic pendulum model to the inclusion of damping and external forcing, we see how small modifications can drastically change the dynamics\u2014from regular oscillations to unpredictable, sensitive motion. Our theoretical exploration laid the groundwork by understanding the forces at play and the role of damping. From there, we introduced the concept of external periodic forcing, which, combined with damping, introduces rich dynamics not present in simpler models. Computational simulations further helped us visualize these effects, showing clear distinctions between underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped cases, as well as transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior when forcing is applied.

Among the most foundational relationships in celestial mechanics is the link between an object's orbital period and its distance from the central mass it orbits. This connection, formalized as Kepler's Third Law, reveals that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. It serves as a vital bridge between Newton's law of gravitation and observed planetary motion. Understanding and deriving this law for circular orbits not only sharpens our grasp of gravitational principles but also has direct applications in calculating the masses of planets and stars, determining satellite trajectories, and understanding the dynamics of stellar systems. In this report, we delve into the theoretical derivation of this relationship, examine its implications in astronomy, and use real-world data to explore its validity. Theoretical Background Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation Newton postulated that any two masses attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] Where: \\(F_g\\) is the gravitational force \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant \\((6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\, \\mathrm{m}^3\\, \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{s}^{-2})\\) \\(M\\) is the mass of the central object (e.g., a planet or star) \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting object (e.g., a satellite or moon) \\(r\\) is the radius of the orbit (distance between the centers of the two bodies) Centripetal Force for Circular Motion An object moving in a circle with constant speed is accelerating toward the center of the circle. The force that causes this acceleration is called the centripetal force, and it is given by: \\[ F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Where: \\(v\\) is the orbital speed of the object \\(m\\) and \\(r\\) are as defined above Equating Gravitational and Centripetal Force For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the object in orbit: \\[ F_g = F_c \\] Substitute the expressions for both forces: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Cancel \\(m\\) from both sides (assuming \\(m \\ne 0\\) ): \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = v^2 \\] Expressing Orbital Velocity in Terms of Period The orbital period \\(T\\) is the time it takes to make one complete orbit. The velocity \\(v\\) in a circular orbit can also be written in terms of \\(T\\) : \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Substitute into the previous equation: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\right)^2 \\] Simplify the right-hand side: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ G M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{T^2} \\] Rearrange to solve for \\(T^2\\) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] Final Form: Kepler\u2019s Third Law for Circular Orbits This final equation expresses Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This relationship shows that, for any object orbiting a much larger mass under gravity in a circular orbit, the square of the orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. Implications in Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law has significant practical applications in astronomy and space science: Calculating Masses : If the orbital radius and period of a satellite or moon are known, one can rearrange the equation to solve for the central mass: $$ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} $$ Determining Distances : In planetary systems where the central mass is known, this law helps estimate distances between celestial bodies and their orbits. Comparing Planets : For planets orbiting the same star (like the Sun), the proportional constant \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}\\) is the same, so comparing \\(T^2\\) and \\(r^3\\) across planets becomes simple. Understanding Orbital Dynamics : It provides insight into how orbital speed and time change with distance, essential for designing satellite trajectories or interplanetary missions. Real-World Examples The Moon's Orbit Around Earth The Moon orbits Earth approximately every 27.3 days at a distance of about 384,400 km. Plugging these values into the derived formula: \\(T = 27.3 \\times 24 \\times 3600 = 2.36 \\times 10^6\\) seconds \\(r = 3.844 \\times 10^8\\) meters We can estimate Earth\u2019s mass: \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] Calculating yields a value close to the known mass of Earth ( \\(\\approx 5.97 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg). Planets in the Solar System By plotting the orbital periods and distances of the planets (with radius in AU and time in Earth years), the graph of \\(T^2\\) vs \\(r^3\\) yields a straight line, further confirming the law. This also helps identify anomalies or perturbations caused by other forces (e.g., gravity from nearby planets). Simulation To verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law computationally, we developed a Python simulation using Newtonian mechanics. The simulation models a set of hypothetical planets in circular orbits around a central star. While the orbital parameters are not based on real planetary data, they are designed to span a realistic range\u2014from close-in orbits similar to Mercury's to distances slightly beyond Jupiter. The orbits are computed assuming only gravitational interaction with the central star, using the simplified form of Newton\u2019s law of gravitation. For each orbit, the orbital period is calculated from the formula: \\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} \\] Where: \\(T\\) is the orbital period, \\(r\\) is the orbital radius, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (the Sun in this case). You can try simulating yourself here The visual output of the simulation includes two key components: Circular Orbits This figure shows eight circular orbits of increasing radii around a central star. Each orbit is marked with a point representing a planet at a fixed position on its path. The central yellow dot represents the star (Sun). The orbits are not scaled to real planetary distances but were chosen to demonstrate the consistent growth in orbital radius and corresponding period. Period-Radius Relationship This graph plots the square of the orbital period ( \\(T^2\\) ) against the cube of the orbital radius ( \\(r^3\\) ). The result is a nearly perfect straight line, confirming the proportionality described by Kepler\u2019s Third Law: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This computational confirmation illustrates how Newtonian gravity naturally produces the laws of planetary motion. Even with synthetic data, the simulation captures the elegant linearity between time and space that governs celestial orbits. Extension to Elliptical Orbits and Other Celestial Bodies Kepler originally formulated his third law based on empirical observations of elliptical orbits, not perfect circles. While our derivation and simulation focused on circular motion for simplicity, the law extends to elliptical orbits as well. In fact, the generalized version of Kepler's Third Law is: \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] Where: \\(T\\) is the orbital period, \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit (the average of the closest and farthest distances from the central body). This generalized form remains valid for all bound orbits governed by gravity, regardless of eccentricity. The only change is that \\(r\\) , the fixed radius in a circular orbit, is replaced by \\(a\\) , the semi-major axis. Applicability Beyond Planets Kepler\u2019s Third Law, when derived from Newton's laws, applies not just to planets orbiting stars but to any two-body system dominated by gravity: Moons orbiting planets (e.g., the Moon around Earth) Satellites orbiting Earth or other bodies Binary star systems Exoplanets around distant stars In each of these cases, as long as the mass of the orbiting body is much smaller than that of the central body (or if reduced mass is used), the relationship holds with high precision. In more complex systems\u2014like multiple stars or galaxies\u2014perturbations, relativistic effects, and mass distributions can introduce deviations, but Newtonian gravity and Kepler\u2019s insight still form the foundational approximation. Conclusion In this report, we derived and explored Kepler\u2019s Third Law using Newtonian mechanics, demonstrating the proportionality between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits. Through theoretical derivation, astronomical applications, real-world examples, and computational simulation, we confirmed the law\u2019s validity and practical significance. The relationship: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3 \\] emerged naturally from equating gravitational and centripetal forces. We showed that it not only explains planetary motion but also allows us to calculate celestial masses and design satellite orbits. The computational model and visualizations provided intuitive insight into how orbits behave under gravity. Finally, we extended the discussion to elliptical orbits and broader gravitational systems, reinforcing the universality of this principle. Kepler\u2019s Third Law remains a cornerstone of classical mechanics and a gateway to understanding more advanced topics in astrophysics, orbital mechanics, and space exploration.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#gravity-orbital-period-and-orbital-radius","text":"","title":"Gravity: Orbital Period and Orbital Radius"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"The motion of celestial bodies has long fascinated scientists and thinkers.

Introduction Gravity is the fundamental force that binds celestial bodies and governs the motion of objects across the universe. To leave the influence of a planet or star, a spacecraft must overcome this gravitational pull\u2014a challenge that lies at the heart of spaceflight. This report explores the concepts of escape velocity and the three so-called cosmic velocities , which define key thresholds in orbital mechanics: The first cosmic velocity is the minimum speed needed to maintain a stable orbit around a body. The second cosmic velocity is the speed required to escape the gravitational influence of a body entirely. The third cosmic velocity is the speed required to leave the gravitational influence of a star from a planet's orbit. Understanding and calculating these velocities is essential for planning satellite launches, interplanetary missions, and, one day, interstellar travel. 2. Theoretical Background 2.1 Escape Velocity: General Concept Escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must reach to break free from a celestial body\u2019s gravitational field without further propulsion . To derive this, consider a body of mass \\(m\\) on the surface of a planet of mass \\(M\\) and radius \\(r\\) . The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) must be zero or positive for the object to escape. At the escape point (infinite distance), kinetic and potential energies are both zero. Using conservation of energy: Initial Energy (on surface): \\[ E_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} \\] Final Energy (at infinity): \\[ E_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\] Setting total energy to zero: \\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = 0 \\] Solve for \\(v\\) : \\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{r} \\] Cancel \\(m\\) from both sides: \\[ \\frac{1}{2}v^2 = \\frac{GM}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by 2: \\[ v^2 = \\frac{2GM}{r} \\] Finally: \\[ \\boxed{v_{\\text{escape}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}} \\] This is the escape velocity . Notably, it does not depend on the object's mass \\(m\\) , only on the planet's mass \\(M\\) and radius \\(r\\) . 2.2 Cosmic Velocities: Definitions and Physical Meaning The term cosmic velocity refers to specific velocity thresholds necessary for different gravitational maneuvers near a celestial body. First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) \u2013 Orbital Speed This is the minimum speed needed to achieve a stable circular orbit around a celestial body just above its surface (neglecting atmospheric drag). For a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force: \\[ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\] Cancel \\(m\\) : \\[ \\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{GM}{r} = v^2 \\] Thus: \\[ \\boxed{v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}} \\] This velocity is approximately 7.9 km/s near Earth's surface. It\u2019s the speed used for satellites like the ISS. Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) \u2013 Escape Speed As derived earlier, the second cosmic velocity is simply: \\[ \\boxed{v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}} \\] This is the speed needed to break free from the planet's gravity without further propulsion. For Earth, this is about 11.2 km/s . Note: \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) \u2013 Solar System Escape Speed The third cosmic velocity is the minimum speed required to escape the Sun's gravity starting from a planet's orbit (e.g., Earth). It's calculated similarly to the escape velocity but with respect to the Sun. Assume the spacecraft has already escaped Earth and is orbiting the Sun at Earth\u2019s orbital radius ( \\(r = 1 \\, \\text{AU} = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m}\\) ). Then: \\[ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_{\\odot}}{r}} \\] Where: - \\( G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\) - \\( M_{\\odot} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) Plugging in the numbers: \\[ v_3 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 \\cdot 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\cdot 1.989 \\times 10^{30}}{1.496 \\times 10^{11}} } \\approx \\sqrt{1.77 \\times 10^9} \\approx 42.1 \\, \\text{km/s} \\] This is the escape velocity from the Sun at Earth's distance. Now, Earth is already moving around the Sun at about 29.8 km/s , so to escape the solar system, a spacecraft only needs to gain: \\[ \\Delta v = 42.1 - 29.8 = 12.3 \\, \\text{km/s} \\] However, if launching from Earth\u2019s surface , the spacecraft must first overcome Earth\u2019s gravity (escape velocity \\( v_2 \\approx 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) ). To estimate the total velocity needed to escape the solar system from Earth\u2019s surface, we can combine these two requirements using the Pythagorean sum (since they're roughly perpendicular in energy terms): \\[ v = \\sqrt{v_2^2 + \\Delta v^2} = \\sqrt{(11.2)^2 + (12.3)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{125.4 + 151.3} = \\sqrt{276.7} \\approx 16.6 \\, \\text{km/s} \\] This is where the commonly quoted 16.7 km/s comes from \u2014 it\u2019s an approximate minimum speed needed from Earth\u2019s surface to fully escape the solar system under ideal conditions. 3. Mathematical Analysis 3.1 Derivations Recap Each cosmic velocity was derived from Newtonian mechanics, assuming: Spherical symmetry No atmosphere No external forces No general relativistic effects To recap: \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) (Circular orbital velocity) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) (Escape velocity from the surface) \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_{\\odot}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}}}\\) (Approximate interstellar escape speed) These formulas can be applied to any spherical celestial body if you know its mass and radius. 3.2 Parameters and Their Influence Key parameters: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) ) \\(M\\) : Mass of the celestial body \\(r\\) : Distance from the center of the body (usually its radius) Observations: Heavier planets (larger \\(M\\) ) \u2192 higher escape/cosmic velocities Larger radius (larger \\(r\\) ) \u2192 lower velocities (since gravity weakens with distance) Jupiter, for instance, despite being farther from the Sun, requires very high \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) due to its massive size The mathematical relationships are inverse-square with distance and direct with mass\u2014very sensitive to the planet's physical properties. 4. Simulation To better understand how the cosmic velocities vary between planets, we implemented a simulation using Python. The script calculates the first , second , and third cosmic velocities for three celestial bodies: Earth , Mars , and Jupiter . The simulation uses the following data for each planet: Mass ( \\(M\\) ) Radius ( \\(r\\) ) Orbital radius around the Sun Orbital speed around the Sun The gravitational constant \\(G\\) is taken as: \\[ G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\] Using these values, we compute: First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ): The speed required to enter a stable circular orbit just above the surface, calculated using: $$ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} $$ Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ): The escape velocity from the surface of the planet, calculated as: $$ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} $$ Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ): The speed needed to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun from the orbit of the planet. The Sun's escape velocity at the planet's orbital radius is calculated with: $$ v_{solar} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_{\\odot}}{R}} $$ Since the planet is already moving with orbital speed \\(v_{orbital}\\) , only the difference \\(\\Delta v = v_{solar} - v_{orbital}\\) needs to be added (in energy terms). The total required velocity from the planet\u2019s surface is: $$ v_3 = \\sqrt{v_2^2 + \\Delta v^2} $$ The results are visualized in the bar graph below: From the graph, we observe the following: Jupiter, due to its massive size and strong gravity, requires much higher \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) compared to Earth and Mars. The third cosmic velocity is highest for Earth, not Jupiter, because Earth orbits closer to the Sun and thus requires more energy to escape the Sun\u2019s gravitational well. Mars, being lighter and farther from the Sun, has the lowest velocities across the board. This simulation helps visualize the real challenges of launching from different planets and planning interplanetary or interstellar missions. You can try simulating yourself here 5. Applications in Space Exploration The concept of cosmic velocities has direct and critical applications in modern spaceflight and mission planning. Each velocity threshold represents a fundamental challenge engineers must overcome to achieve various levels of orbital and interplanetary travel. 5.1 Launching Satellites \u2013 First Cosmic Velocity To place satellites in orbit around Earth (or any planet), a spacecraft must achieve at least the first cosmic velocity . This speed is what allows satellites to continuously fall around the planet due to gravity without ever hitting the surface. Examples: The International Space Station (ISS) orbits at approximately 7.66 km/s. GPS satellites, weather satellites, and communication satellites all rely on reaching this speed to maintain low-Earth or geosynchronous orbits. Rocket launches are engineered to gradually accelerate through the atmosphere and reach this velocity at the desired altitude, taking atmospheric drag and rotation of the Earth into account. 5.2 Interplanetary Missions \u2013 Second Cosmic Velocity To send a spacecraft beyond Earth\u2014toward the Moon, Mars, or the outer planets\u2014it must exceed the second cosmic velocity , or escape velocity from Earth. This allows the spacecraft to leave Earth\u2019s gravitational influence and enter a solar orbit. Historical examples: Apollo missions : The Saturn V had to push the command module to speeds above 11.2 km/s to reach the Moon. Mars rovers and orbiters must first escape Earth\u2019s gravity before initiating transfer orbits to Mars. While gravitational assists (like flybys) and multi-stage rockets help reduce direct fuel costs, \\(v_2\\) is still the baseline challenge for any interplanetary launch. 5.3 Interstellar Prospects \u2013 Third Cosmic Velocity The third cosmic velocity represents a much more ambitious goal: escaping the gravitational pull of the entire solar system. Real-world example: Voyager 1 is the only human-made object to have fully achieved this. After gravity assists from Jupiter and Saturn, it reached escape speed and is now traveling through interstellar space. New Horizons , which flew past Pluto, is also on an escape trajectory but will take much longer to leave the heliosphere. Achieving this velocity directly from Earth is extremely energy-intensive. That\u2019s why missions usually build up speed using planetary flybys or other orbital maneuvers rather than brute-force launches. The third cosmic velocity sets the theoretical lower bound for interstellar travel \u2014one of the final frontiers of human exploration. 6. Conclusion This report explored the theoretical and practical aspects of cosmic velocities , grounding each concept in physical laws and demonstrating their application to real-world spaceflight. We derived: The first cosmic velocity as the orbital speed near the surface. The second cosmic velocity as the escape speed from a celestial body. The third cosmic velocity as the speed needed to leave the solar system. Through simulation, we compared how these velocities vary for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, reinforcing how a planet\u2019s mass and distance from the Sun affect mission requirements. Finally, we connected these velocities to key phases of space exploration: Satellite deployment Planetary missions Interstellar probes Understanding these velocity thresholds is not just academic\u2014it\u2019s essential for designing efficient launch systems, reducing energy costs, and exploring beyond Earth. As we push further into space, these classical mechanics continue to define the boundaries of the possible.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_2/#escape-and-cosmic-velocities-the-physics-of-leaving-worlds","text":"","title":"Escape and Cosmic Velocities \u2013 The Physics of Leaving Worlds"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_2/#1-introduction","text":"Gravity is the fundamental force that binds celestial bodies and governs the motion of objects across the universe.

This report analyzes the physical principles governing these trajectories, focusing on the classification of orbital paths\u2014elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic\u2014and the factors influencing them. We then establish a mathematical model to simulate the payload's motion under Earth's gravity. Theoretical Background Newtonian Gravity The force between two masses under Newtonian gravity is given by: \\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\] Where: \\( F \\) is the gravitational force, \\( G \\approx 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3\\text{kg}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-2} \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of Earth and the payload, \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses. For a small payload near Earth, the motion is dominated by Earth's gravitational field: \\[ F = m \\cdot a = G \\frac{M_E m}{r^2} \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{G M_E}{r^2} \\] Gravitational Potential Energy and Escape Velocity The gravitational potential energy is: \\[ U(r) = -\\frac{G M_E m}{r} \\] The escape velocity from a given distance \\( r \\) from Earth\u2019s center is derived from setting total mechanical energy to zero: \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_E}{r}} \\] If the object\u2019s speed exceeds this, it will escape Earth\u2019s gravity. Types of Trajectories The shape of the trajectory depends on the total specific mechanical energy \\( \\varepsilon \\) of the object: \\[ \\varepsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{G M_E}{r} \\] If \\( \\varepsilon < 0 \\) : Bound orbit (circular or elliptical) If \\( \\varepsilon = 0 \\) : Parabolic trajectory (escape at exactly escape velocity) If \\( \\varepsilon > 0 \\) : Hyperbolic trajectory (unbound escape) These relate directly to orbital shapes derived from conic sections in central-force problems. Orbital Mechanics and Kepler\u2019s Laws Kepler\u2019s Laws describe planetary motion in bound orbits: Orbits are ellipses with Earth at one focus. The line joining the planet and Earth sweeps out equal areas in equal times. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] For payloads near Earth, these laws apply to elliptical orbits under the assumption of two-body motion. Equations of Motion To simulate the motion, we start from Newton\u2019s Second Law in vector form: \\[ \\vec{a} = -\\frac{G M_E}{r^3} \\vec{r} \\] This second-order differential equation governs the position vector \\( \\vec{r}(t) \\) over time.

Assumptions and Simplifications To make the problem tractable, we adopt the following assumptions: The Earth is a perfect sphere with uniform mass. The atmosphere is neglected (vacuum conditions). Only Earth's gravity is considered (no third-body effects). Motion is planar (2D), with the Earth's center at the origin. The payload's mass is negligible compared to Earth (two-body approximation). Simulation You can try simulating yourself here This simulation visualizes various trajectories of a payload released near Earth at an altitude of 300 km. Each path corresponds to a different set of initial velocity conditions, demonstrating how these affect the outcome: Free fall (vx=0, vy=0): The payload follows a straight downward path under gravity, crashing back into Earth. Circular orbit (vx=0, vy=7600 m/s): The velocity is approximately equal to the required speed for a low Earth orbit, producing a stable circular trajectory. Escape trajectory (vx=0, vy=11200 m/s): This velocity matches Earth's escape velocity at 300 km altitude, causing the payload to escape Earth's gravity well. Elliptical orbit (vx=0, vy=9000 m/s): Higher than orbital speed but lower than escape velocity, resulting in a stretched elliptical orbit. Oblique trajectory (vx=3000, vy=3000 m/s): With components in both axes, the payload follows a complex elliptical or suborbital path, depending on its total energy. All trajectories are computed using Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation with a time-stepped numerical method. The simulation helps illustrate how even small changes in velocity and direction can dramatically alter the payload\u2019s fate\u2014be it orbital insertion, reentry, or escape. Applications and Implications Understanding the trajectories of released payloads is critical for several areas of aerospace engineering and space mission planning: Satellite Deployment : Precise velocity control is required to insert satellites into stable orbits. A small deviation may result in suborbital reentry or an unintended elliptical orbit. Orbital Maneuvers : Payloads transferred between orbits (e.g., from low Earth orbit to geostationary) follow elliptical transfer paths. These transitions rely on short, calculated bursts (impulses) to adjust velocity. Reentry Scenarios : Controlled reentry missions (e.g., return capsules or deorbiting satellites) must carefully reduce velocity to avoid skipping off the atmosphere or burning up. Trajectory modeling helps define safe reentry corridors. Escape Missions : Missions aiming to leave Earth\u2019s gravity (e.g., interplanetary probes) must achieve escape velocity. The simulation illustrates how exceeding critical energy thresholds leads to hyperbolic escape paths. Space Debris Risk Assessment : Modeling trajectories of malfunctioning or deorbited payloads helps predict impact zones or decay paths, crucial for safety and mitigation planning. These applications reveal how orbital mechanics and gravitational modeling directly influence mission success, cost, and safety. Conclusion This report analyzed the motion of a payload released near Earth under the influence of gravity. Using Newtonian mechanics, we derived the fundamental equations governing gravitational acceleration and related them to conic-section trajectory types.

Through this approach, we will gain practical insights into wave behavior and the fundamental principles governing interference, enhancing our comprehension of both theoretical and applied wave physics.","title":"Objective"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#fundamental-concepts-of-waves","text":"","title":"Fundamental Concepts of Waves"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#wave-properties","text":"Waves are characterized by several fundamental properties that define their behavior: Amplitude (A) : The maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position.

Ultimately, this work aims to bridge theory and application \u2014 providing insights not only into particle dynamics but also into the operation of devices that harness these fundamental physical principles. Theoretical Background The behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields is governed by the Lorentz force , which acts as the fundamental law of motion in electromagnetic systems. The total force \\(\\vec{F}\\) acting on a particle with charge \\(q\\) and velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) in the presence of electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) is given by: \\[ \\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\] This expression combines the effects of the electric force \\(q\\vec{E}\\) and the magnetic force \\(q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\) . The resulting trajectory of the particle depends on the initial velocity, the magnitude and direction of the fields, and the particle\u2019s charge and mass. Equation of Motion From Newton\u2019s second law, the acceleration of the particle is: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} \\] Substituting the Lorentz force: \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{q}{m} (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\] This is a system of coupled, first-order differential equations that describe the time evolution of the particle\u2019s velocity. By further integrating, we can obtain the position: \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\] Thus, we have a full system of equations for velocity and position that can be solved numerically. Motion in Uniform Fields Only Magnetic Field Present ( \\(\\vec{E} = 0\\) ): In the presence of a uniform magnetic field and no electric field, the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both the velocity and the field direction. This results in circular or helical motion . The radius of the circular trajectory, known as the Larmor radius , is given by: $$ r_L = \\frac{mv_\\perp}{|qB|} $$ where \\(v_\\perp\\) is the component of velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field. The corresponding cyclotron frequency (or Larmor frequency) is: $$ \\omega_c = \\frac{|qB|}{m} $$ Only Electric Field Present ( \\(\\vec{B} = 0\\) ): The motion becomes purely linear with constant acceleration: $$ \\vec{a} = \\frac{q\\vec{E}}{m} $$ Crossed Fields ( \\(\\vec{E} \\perp \\vec{B}\\) ): When both fields are present and perpendicular, the particle exhibits a drift motion perpendicular to both \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) . This is known as the E \u00d7 B drift , with velocity: $$ \\vec{v}_d = \\frac{\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}}{B^2} $$ Notably, this drift velocity is independent of the particle\u2019s charge or mass . The Right-Hand Rule To determine the direction of the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, we use the right-hand rule : Point your fingers in the direction of the particle\u2019s velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) . Curl them toward the direction of the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) . Your thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic force \\(\\vec{F}_L\\) for a positive charge .

It states that, under certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution of the population. Understanding the CLT is crucial because it explains why the normal distribution appears so frequently in practice. Simulations offer an intuitive and hands-on method for visualizing and confirming the behavior predicted by the theorem. This report explores the CLT through computational experiments by sampling from different types of distributions and observing the convergence of the sample mean's distribution toward normality. Theoretical Background The Central Limit Theorem can be formally stated as follows: If \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean \\(\\mu\\) and finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) , then as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\overline{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\] where: \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) is the sample mean \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the population variance \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) denotes the standard normal distribution This result explains why the normal distribution arises so often in statistics \u2014 regardless of the underlying population distribution, the sample mean will follow a normal distribution for sufficiently large \\(n\\) . Methodology Tools and Libraries The simulations were conducted using Python, with the following libraries: NumPy: for random number generation and basic statistical operations Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization Population Distributions Three types of distributions were selected to represent different characteristics: Uniform distribution : symmetric with bounded support Exponential distribution : highly skewed and unbounded on the positive side Binomial distribution : discrete distribution with two outcomes For each distribution: A large population dataset (e.g., 100,000 points) was generated Sampling was performed at various sample sizes: \\(n = 5, 10, 30, 50\\) Sampling Procedure For each sample size: A large number of samples (e.g., 1,000) were drawn The mean of each sample was calculated The resulting sampling distributions of the means were plotted By comparing the sampling distributions at different sample sizes, the convergence towards normality was analyzed and visualized. Simulation The following plots show the sampling distributions of the sample mean for increasing sample sizes ( \\(n = 5, 10, 30, 50\\) ), taken from three different population distributions: Uniform, Exponential, and Binomial. Each histogram is based on 1,000 samples, with the population mean marked by a red dashed line. These simulations demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem in action, though not always in a textbook-perfect way: Uniform Distribution : The sampling distributions of the mean exhibit a clear trend toward normality as the sample size increases. Even at \\(n=5\\) , the distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped, although somewhat rough and irregular due to smaller sample averaging. As \\(n\\) increases to 10, 30, and finally 50, the distributions become increasingly concentrated around the population mean (0.5), and the shape becomes smoother and more Gaussian. This case confirms the Central Limit Theorem effectively. The original uniform distribution is flat, but the sample means quickly aggregate toward a normal distribution. No significant skewness is observed in any of the plots; the irregularities at lower \\(n\\) are due to sampling noise and limited averaging. By \\(n=30\\) and especially \\(n=50\\) , the shape closely resembles a normal distribution both visually and in symmetry. Exponential Distribution : (Assuming from previous screenshots) starts highly skewed. The sampling distribution slowly becomes more symmetric and centered around the mean. However, even at \\(n=30\\) or \\(n=50\\) , a small right-skew might remain due to the heavy tail of the population. Binomial Distribution : Since the original distribution is already symmetric (with \\(p=0.5\\) ), convergence is more visible. At \\(n=30\\) , the sampling distribution is already close to a bell curve, but due to the discrete nature of the data, it appears a bit jagged even at \\(n=50\\) . These visualizations show that while the Central Limit Theorem does hold, the rate of convergence and the smoothness of the sampling distribution depend on both the original distribution\u2019s shape and whether the data is discrete or continuous. The simulation can be found here . Uniform Exponential Binomial Practical Applications The Central Limit Theorem is not just a theoretical result; it has wide-reaching practical value across disciplines: Statistical Inference : Most confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are based on the assumption of normality in sample means. Thanks to the CLT, these tools remain reliable even when sampling from non-normal populations. Quality Control : In manufacturing, averages of product measurements are often tracked. The CLT justifies using control charts and standard thresholds based on normal distributions, even if the underlying measurement distributions are not normal. Finance and Risk Management : Portfolio returns over time are modeled using the normal distribution. The CLT provides the justification for aggregating returns and assuming a bell curve behavior in risk modeling. Social Sciences and Biology : Sample averages are foundational in survey analysis, clinical trials, and experiments where underlying variables often don\u2019t follow normal distributions, but the means can be treated as such thanks to the CLT. In short, the CLT underpins much of modern applied statistics and allows for robust inference from data in a wide range of contexts. Discussion The simulations confirm the core intuition of the Central Limit Theorem: regardless of the original distribution \u2014 whether flat (uniform), discrete (binomial), or skewed (exponential) \u2014 the distribution of the sample mean tends toward normality as the sample size increases. However, the rate and appearance of this convergence vary: - Uniform distribution converged rapidly and showed a symmetric bell shape by \\(n = 30\\) . - Binomial, already symmetric at the population level, showed early convergence but remained jagged due to its discrete nature. - (Pending Exponential visuals) The exponential distribution, being heavily skewed, likely converges more slowly and retains some asymmetry even at larger \\(n\\) . Additionally, the smoothness of the sampling distributions improves as \\(n\\) increases, and the standard deviation of sample means becomes tighter \u2014 as predicted by the formula \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}\\) . These results reinforce both the power and the limits of the CLT: it works, but not instantly, and its appearance is shaped by the nature of the original data. Conclusion Through simulation and visual analysis, this report has demonstrated the Central Limit Theorem in action. As sample sizes grow, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes increasingly normal, even when drawn from non-normal populations. This empirical approach shows how the CLT serves as a bridge between the unpredictable nature of raw data and the structured, predictable behavior of sample averages. It is this principle that allows statisticians and scientists to draw valid conclusions from limited data in real-world scenarios. While convergence depends on factors such as distribution shape, discreteness, and variance, the overall trend is unmistakable: large enough samples tend to behave normally \u2014 and this insight is foundational to the field of statistics.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#exploring-the-central-limit-theorem-through-simulations","text":"","title":"Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a foundational principle in probability and statistics.

These techniques are widely used in fields such as physics, finance, and computer science to simulate systems with a high degree of complexity or randomness. One of the most elegant and accessible applications of Monte Carlo simulation is the estimation of the mathematical constant \\(\\pi\\) through geometric probability. In this part of the report (Part 1), we focus on estimating \\(\\pi\\) by simulating random points within a square that bounds a unit circle. This method is visually intuitive, mathematically simple, and demonstrates how randomness can be used to solve problems in numerical analysis and statistical physics. Theoretical Foundation Consider a square of side length 2 centered at the origin. Inscribed within this square is a circle of radius 1, also centered at the origin. The area of the square is: \\[ A_{\\text{square}} = (2)^2 = 4 \\] The area of the circle is: \\[ A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi \\] If we generate a large number of random points uniformly distributed within the square, the probability that a point falls inside the circle is equal to the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area: \\[ P = \\frac{A_{\\text{circle}}}{A_{\\text{square}}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\] Solving for \\(\\pi\\) , we get: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\frac{N_{\\text{circle}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} \\] Where: \\(N_{\\text{circle}}\\) is the number of points that fall inside the circle, \\(N_{\\text{total}}\\) is the total number of points generated. A point \\((x, y)\\) lies inside the circle if it satisfies the inequality: \\[ x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1 \\] By simulating a large number of such points and applying the formula above, we can estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\) . The larger the number of samples, the closer the estimate tends to be Simulation You can try choosing the number of points yourself here . As seen in the plots above, the accuracy of the \\(\\pi\\) estimation improves as the number of randomly generated points increases. With only 1,000 points, the estimate fluctuates significantly, and the distribution appears uneven. At 10,000 points, the circle becomes more densely filled, and the estimation stabilizes. At 100,000 points, the estimate of \\(\\pi\\) closely approaches the actual value, and the visual difference between inside and outside points becomes much more refined. The table below further supports this observation by listing 10 separate simulations for each point count.

By generating uniformly distributed random points within a square and measuring how many fell inside the inscribed unit circle, we derived an approximation for \\(\\pi\\) based on the ratio of areas. Through visualizations and repeated simulations, we observed that the accuracy of the estimate improves significantly with the number of random samples. At low sample sizes, the estimates fluctuate noticeably, but as the number of points increases, the approximation stabilizes and converges toward the true value of \\(\\pi\\) . This aligns with the law of large numbers and highlights a core strength of Monte Carlo methods: their simplicity and reliability when scaled.

Part 2: Buffon\u2019s Needle Experiment Introduction In the 18th century, the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, proposed one of the earliest known problems in geometric probability \u2014 now known as Buffon\u2019s Needle . The question was simple: if a needle is dropped onto a floor marked with equally spaced parallel lines, what is the probability that it will cross one of the lines? Surprisingly, this probability turns out to be related to the value of \\(\\pi\\) . This makes Buffon\u2019s Needle one of the oldest and most elegant probabilistic methods to estimate \\(\\pi\\) , and it provides a fascinating example of how geometry, randomness, and probability intersect. In this part of the report, we explore this method both theoretically and computationally through Monte Carlo simulation. Theoretical Foundation Imagine a floor with horizontal parallel lines spaced a distance \\(d\\) apart. A needle of length \\(l\\) is randomly dropped onto the floor. For the case where the needle length satisfies \\(l \\leq d\\) , the probability that it crosses one of the lines is given by: \\[ P = \\frac{2l}{\\pi d} \\] To understand this, consider two random variables: \\(x\\) : the perpendicular distance from the needle's center to the nearest line, uniformly distributed in \\([0, \\frac{d}{2}]\\) . \\(\\theta\\) : the acute angle between the needle and the lines, uniformly distributed in \\([0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\) . A crossing occurs if the vertical projection of the needle half-length exceeds the distance to the nearest line: \\[ \\frac{l}{2} \\sin(\\theta) \\geq x \\] By integrating over the joint probability distribution of \\(x\\) and \\(\\theta\\) , the probability of a crossing yields the formula above. Rearranging this, we can estimate \\(\\pi\\) by observing the frequency of crossings in a simulation: \\[ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2l \\cdot N}{d \\cdot C} \\] Where: \\(N\\) is the total number of needle drops, \\(C\\) is the number of times the needle crosses a line. This formula allows us to estimate \\(\\pi\\) empirically, using randomness and geometry. As with the circle-based method, accuracy improves with the number of trials, although convergence tends to be slower due to the geometric nature of the crossing condition. Simulation To put the theory into practice, we simulate Buffon\u2019s Needle experiment using different numbers of needle drops: 100, 10,000, and 100,000. Each drop involves generating a random angle and a random position, then checking whether the needle crosses one of the horizontal lines. This process allows us to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the proportion of crossings, as derived in the theoretical section. You can try choosing the number of needle drops yourself here . In the visualizations above, red needles indicate those that cross a line, while blue needles do not . This coloring provides a clear geometric interpretation of the condition used to determine whether a crossing occurs. To avoid overloading the plot, we limit the visualization to a maximum of around 300 needles even if the total number of simulated drops is much higher. This makes the figure readable while still accurately representing the behavior of the method. The full sample size, however, is used for the numerical estimation of \\(\\pi\\) , which is summarized in the table below.

Through simulation, we observed how the proportion of needle crossings can be translated into an approximation of \\(\\pi\\) using a simple yet elegant probabilistic formula. However, this method shows significant variance at low sample sizes, as demonstrated in the table. With only 100 drops, the estimates fluctuate dramatically. At 10,000 and 100,000 drops, the estimation stabilizes and begins to approach the true value of \\(\\pi\\) , though not as tightly as the circle-based method. While visually engaging and conceptually rich, Buffon\u2019s Needle converges more slowly and is more sensitive to sample size, making it a good educational example but a less efficient estimator in practice. Final Comparison and Overall Conclusion Both the circle-based and Buffon\u2019s Needle Monte Carlo methods provide effective ways to estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\) , but they differ in simplicity, efficiency, and convergence behavior. Accuracy and Convergence: The circle method produced estimates with relatively low variance, even at moderate sample sizes. Its average estimate with 100,000 points was 3.143816 , closely matching the known value of \\(\\pi\\) . In contrast, Buffon\u2019s Needle showed greater variability, especially at low drop counts. With 100,000 drops, it achieved a respectable average of 3.142017 , but required more samples to reach comparable stability. Computational Considerations: The circle method is computationally straightforward, requiring only basic distance checks in 2D space. Buffon\u2019s method involves trigonometric functions and more nuanced geometric constraints, which adds a layer of complexity and slower convergence. Educational Value: Buffon\u2019s Needle stands out for its historical importance and the way it links geometry, randomness, and probability in a tangible way. The circle method is more practical for teaching basic Monte Carlo estimation and convergence principles. Final Thoughts: In conclusion, both simulations demonstrate how randomness can be used to solve deterministic mathematical problems. While the circle-based method is more efficient and precise for estimating \\(\\pi\\) , Buffon\u2019s Needle offers a unique and intellectually rich perspective that connects modern simulation with classical probability. Together, they highlight the versatility of Monte Carlo methods and their value in both computation and education.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#estimating-pi-using-monte-carlo-methods","text":"Part 1: Geometric Probability with a Circle","title":"Estimating \\(\\pi\\) Using Monte Carlo Methods"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#introduction","text":"Monte Carlo methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

It governs the motion of falling objects, the behavior of projectiles, and is crucial in engineering, astronomy, and many other domains. One classic method of determining \\(g\\) is through the use of a simple pendulum, where the period of oscillation is directly related to the gravitational force acting on it. In this report, we simulate the experiment using Python. The simulation mimics a real-life setup by adding controlled noise to the timing data, allowing us to practice data collection, averaging, and error analysis without the variability of physical equipment. This approach highlights the core concepts of experimental measurement and uncertainty propagation. Theoretical Background Pendulum Equation For small angular displacements (less than 15\u00b0), the period \\(T\\) of a simple pendulum is given by: \\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}} \\] where: \\(T\\) is the period in seconds (s), \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum in meters (m), \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration in meters per second squared ( \\(\\mathrm{m/s^2}\\) ), \\(\\pi \\approx 3.1416\\) . Solving this equation for \\(g\\) : \\[ g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2} \\] Uncertainty Propagation In practice, measurements are not exact. Each value has an associated uncertainty: - \\(\\Delta L\\) : uncertainty in pendulum length, - \\(\\Delta T\\) : uncertainty in period measurement. We propagate uncertainty into the final value of \\(g\\) using: \\[ \\Delta g = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{T^2} \\cdot \\Delta L \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^2 L}{T^3} \\cdot \\Delta T \\right)^2 } \\] Due to the squared dependence of \\(T\\) in the denominator, uncertainty in time has a stronger influence on the final result than uncertainty in length. Simulation Method The simulation assumes: True gravitational acceleration: \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) , Pendulum length: \\(L = 1.00 \\pm 0.005 \\, \\text{m}\\) , 10 trials, each measuring the time for 10 oscillations, Random timing noise: standard deviation of \\(0.3\\) seconds over 10 oscillations. Each trial generates a noisy time for 10 swings, which is then divided by 10 to estimate the period. You can try simulating yourself here Data Collection The table below shows the results of the 10 simulated timing measurements and their calculated periods: Trial Time for 10 Oscillations (s) Period (s) 1 20.210 2.021 2 20.019 2.002 3 20.255 2.025 4 20.518 2.052 5 19.990 1.999 6 19.990 1.999 7 20.534 2.053 8 20.291 2.029 9 19.920 1.992 10 20.223 2.022 Below is the plot showing all 10 trials, with individual error bars representing the simulated timing noise: Data Analysis From the 10 simulated trials, we calculate: Mean Period : \\(T = 2.0195 \\, \\text{s}\\) Standard Deviation : \\(\\sigma_T = 0.0217 \\, \\text{s}\\) Uncertainty in Mean Period : \\(\\Delta T = \\frac{\\sigma_T}{\\sqrt{10}} \\approx 0.0069 \\, \\text{s}\\) Substituting into the formula for \\(g\\) : \\[ g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 \\cdot 1.00}{(2.0195)^2} \\approx 9.68 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\] And the uncertainty: \\[ \\Delta g \\approx 0.08 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\] So, the final result is: \\[ g = 9.68 \\pm 0.08 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\] Percentage Error : \\(\\approx 1.33\\%\\) from the true value \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) Results The simulation produces realistic, slightly noisy period measurements resembling what might be seen with a stopwatch in a classroom experiment. The estimated value of \\(g\\) is reasonably close to the actual gravitational acceleration, with a small error margin. Most of the uncertainty comes from variability in timing, reinforcing how sensitive the calculation is to small errors in the period. This aligns with the theoretical expectations. Discussion of Uncertainty and Its Impact This simulation incorporates two major sources of uncertainty: Length Measurement ( \\(\\Delta L\\) ) : The pendulum length was set at \\(L = 1.00 \\pm 0.005 \\, \\text{m}\\) . Since \\(L\\) appears in the numerator of the formula for \\(g\\) , small errors in \\(L\\) result in proportional but relatively mild effects on the result. Timing Variability ( \\(\\Delta T\\) ) : The time for 10 oscillations was affected by simulated random noise, mimicking human reaction error or a low-resolution stopwatch. Because \\(T\\) is squared in the formula for \\(g\\) , even slight errors in \\(T\\) lead to larger deviations in the result. This is confirmed in the uncertainty formula, where the timing term contributes significantly more than the length term. The final uncertainty in \\(g\\) ( \\(\\Delta g = 0.08 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ) was dominated by the uncertainty in timing. This highlights the importance of repeated measurements and averaging, especially in timing-based experiments. Despite these uncertainties, the simulation achieved a result within 1.33% of the accepted value, validating both the method and the importance of careful measurement design. Conclusion The pendulum remains a simple yet powerful tool to measure gravitational acceleration. Even when simulated, the experiment teaches important lessons about measurement uncertainty, data handling, and analysis. The result \u2014 \\(g = 9.68 \\pm 0.08 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) \u2014 confirms the validity of the method, especially when repeated trials and averaging are used to reduce error. Simulation allowed for control and repeatability, making it an effective alternative for understanding the core concepts of experimental physics.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#measuring-earths-gravitational-acceleration-using-a-pendulum-simulation-based","text":"","title":"Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration Using a Pendulum (Simulation-Based)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"The acceleration due to gravity, denoted as \\(g\\) , is one of the most fundamental constants in physics.
