This report investigates how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Theoretical Foundation In the foundation of projectile movement lie the Laws of Newton: First Law An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. In terms of projectile motion, this means that once an object is in motion (like a ball thrown in the air), it will keep moving at a constant velocity in a straight line unless a force (like gravity or air resistance) acts on it. Second Law This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass: \\(F=ma\\) Where: F is the net force m is the mass of the object a is the acceleration In projectile motion, gravity provides a constant downward force that accelerates the object downward at a rate of approximately \\(9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\) (on Earth). Third Law This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In projectile motion, this law isn't as directly involved in the motion of the object but can be observed in other interactions. Motion Components A projectile moves under the influence of gravity, meaning its horizontal and vertical motions are independent except for the time variable. The acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, making the motion two-dimensional. Horizontal Motion : The object moves horizontally with a constant velocity (since there is no force acting horizontally, assuming no air resistance). Vertical Motion : The object moves vertically with constant acceleration due to gravity, starting with an initial velocity in the upward direction (if thrown upward) or zero velocity (if dropped). Main formulas: \\(x(t) = v_0\\cos(\u03b8)t\\) - horizontal displacement This equation comes from the definition of constant velocity motion: The horizontal component of velocity is \\( v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\) (initial velocity times the cosine of the launch angle). There is no acceleration in the x-direction (ignoring air resistance), so distance is simply velocity times time. \\(y(t) = v_0\\sin(\u03b8)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) - vertical displacement This equation follows from the kinematic equation for motion under constant acceleration: \\[ y = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] Since gravity acts downward with acceleration \\( g \\) , we replace \\( a \\) with \\( -g \\) , leading to the negative term. From the two formulas a single formula for the distance can be derived: 1. Determine the Total Time of Flight The vertical displacement equation for projectile motion is: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Since the projectile returns to the ground, we set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve for \\( t \\) : $$ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Factor out \\( t \\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ This gives two solutions: $$ t = 0 \\quad \\text{(initial time)} $$ $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Thus, the total time of flight is: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 2. Use the Horizontal Displacement Formula The horizontal displacement is given by: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Since range \\( R \\) is the total horizontal distance when the projectile lands, we substitute \\( t = T \\) : $$ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ 3. Simplify Using Trigonometric Identity Using the identity \\( \\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) \\) , we get: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Conclusion Thus, the range formula for projectile motion is: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Analyzing the Range with Regard to Angle The range is directly proportional to \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) , meaning that if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) increases, the range also increases, and if \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) decreases, the range decreases accordingly. To analyze how the range varies with \\( \\theta \\) , we observe that: The function \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) reaches its maximum value of 1 when \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , or equivalently, \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . This means the projectile achieves its maximum range at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Since the sine function is symmetric about \\( 90^\\circ \\) , the range is the same for angles that sum to \\( 90^\\circ \\) (e.g., \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) yield the same range). For small or large angles near \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\) , \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) approaches zero, causing the range to decrease. The following graph illustrates the relationship between \\( R \\) and \\( \\theta \\) , showing how the range increases up to \\( 45^\\circ \\) and then decreases symmetrically. The velocity was chosen However, angle is not a single parameter that determines the range - there is also velocity and gravitational acceleration: Velocity is proportional to the range, as it stands in the numerator of the equation. The higher the velocity - the higher the distance that the object is able to travel. For example, let's compare the initial velocity of the thrown object of 10 m/s and 20 m/s by putting them into the formula and plotting their trajectories. We will use the same angle for both instances of 45\u00b0. \\(10 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{10^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 10m \\] \\(20 m/s\\) \\[ R = \\frac{20^2 \\sin(2*45\u00b0)}{g} = 40 m \\] Gravitational acceleration is antiproportional to the range, as it stands in the denomenator of the equation. The higher the gravitational acceleration - the faster the object is gonna fall, and hence, the less distance it will be able to travel. To visualise that, we can again try to plot different trajectories, but this time changing only the gravitational acceleration. The velocity and the angle are going to remain the same: 10 m/s and 45\u00b0 respectively: The picture depicts the trajectory the object would have if it was thrown on the surface of different celestial bodies, namely: Earth Moon Mars Jupiter As Jupiter is the most massive among these bodies, its gravitational force is also the largest which means that the range is the smallest, while the moon is the lightest among these bodies, and the range is respectively the biggest. Practical applications Projectile motion lies at the foundation of mechanics and has countless applications in real life. It can be seen in something as simple as children throwing snowballs in winter or as complex as launching a missile to another country. However, real-life applications are more complex than a simple formula. We must account for air resistance, uneven terrain, and other forces that could affect the flight. For example, air resistance slows down the object by absorbing some of its energy. Additionally, an object may land higher or lower than its initial position depending on the terrain, which would influence its flight range. A model of the influence of the terrain: Implementation The following representation allows to built your own trajectory based on the entered parameters. Try tweaking the velocity, angle, and gravity to see how the trajectory changes: Conclusion In this report, we investigated projectile motion, explored its theoretical foundation, analyzed the function's range, discussed practical applications, and implemented its trajectory using Python code.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics.

Objective of the Report This report will explore the forced damped pendulum from different angles: Theoretical Foundation: We'll look at the main equation that describes its motion and see how it behaves under different conditions. Analysis of Dynamics: We'll explore how changing factors like friction, the strength of the external force, and its frequency affect the pendulum's motion, including how it can become chaotic. Practical Applications: We'll discuss real-world systems that work similarly, such as energy harvesting devices and vibration control systems. Computational Implementation: We'll create a computer simulation to visualize how the pendulum moves under different conditions and analyze its behavior using tools like phase diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections. By the end of this report, we should have a clearer understanding of how the forced damped pendulum works and why it is relevant to various fields of science and engineering. Theoretical Foundation Simple Pendulum To understand forced damping pendulum, let's start with a simple pendulum to build up on that, gradually understanding phenomena of \"damping\" and \"forcing\" A simple pendulum is a mass (called the bob) attached to a string or rod that swings back and forth under the influence of gravity. The key features of a simple pendulum are: The bob is usually a small, dense object like a metal ball. The string or rod is ideally massless and inextensible (it doesn\u2019t stretch). The pendulum moves in a plane and oscillates around a fixed point. When displaced from its equilibrium position and released, the pendulum swings back and forth in a periodic motion. How does it work? The motion of a simple pendulum can be broken down using physics concepts like circular motion and gravitation. The forces on the pendulum bob are: Gravity : Acts downward with magnitude \\( mg \\) . Tension (T) : Acts along the string, providing a radial force. $$$$ Gravity can be decomposed into: Radial component : \\( mg \\cos\\theta \\) - Points toward the pivot and is balanced by the tension in the string. Tangential component : \\( mg \\sin\\theta \\) (causes oscillation) - Acts along the direction of motion and is responsible for the pendulum's oscillation. Circular Motion Equations: Since the pendulum moves along a circular arc of radius \\( L \\) (length of string), the radial and tangential forces obey: Radial force equation: $$ T - mg \\cos\\theta = m \\frac{v^2}{L} $$ Tangential force equation (Newton's Second Law in tangential direction): Tangential Force : $$ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -mg \\sin\\theta $$ where: \\( m \\) is the mass, \\( \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} \\) is tangential acceleration, \\( -mg \\sin\\theta \\) is the tangential component of gravitational force. Arc Length Relation : Since \\( s = L\\theta \\) (where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement), we differentiate to find: $$ \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} $$ Simplified Equation : Substituting this into the original equation: $$ L \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -g \\sin\\theta $$ Simplifying further: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 $$ This is the equation governing the angular motion of a pendulum. It describes the angular acceleration \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\) as a function of the angle \\( \\theta \\) . Damping in a Pendulum Introduction In an idealized simple pendulum, motion continues indefinitely without any loss of energy. However, in real-world scenarios, a pendulum experiences resistance forces such as air drag and friction at the pivot, leading to energy dissipation over time. This phenomenon is known as damping . The Damped Pendulum Equation To account for damping, an additional term is introduced in Newton\u2019s Second Law, representing a resistive force proportional to velocity: \\[ m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + b \\frac{ds}{dt} + mg \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] where: \\( m \\) is the mass of the pendulum bob, \\( s \\) is the arc length (or \\( \\theta \\) for angular motion), \\( b \\) is the damping coefficient (determining the strength of resistance), \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In terms of angular displacement \\( \\theta \\) , using \\( s = L\\theta \\) : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{mL} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] Types of Damping Depending on the value of the damping coefficient \\( b \\) , different types of damping occur: Underdamped ( \\( b^2 < \\frac{4m^2g}{L} \\) ) The pendulum oscillates but gradually loses energy. The amplitude decreases exponentially over time. Critically Damped ( \\( b^2 = \\frac{4m^2g}{L} \\) ) The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. This is often used in engineering to prevent overshooting (e.g., car suspension systems). Overdamped ( \\( b^2 > \\frac{4m^2g}{L} \\) ) The pendulum returns to equilibrium very slowly without oscillating. Energy loss is so strong that motion is heavily suppressed. Real-World Examples of Damping A grandfather clock experiences slow air resistance and slight friction at the pivot, leading to a gradual decrease in amplitude if not wound regularly. Seismic dampers in buildings use overdamping principles to reduce vibrations during earthquakes. Automotive shock absorbers operate near critical damping to ensure smooth and stable motion after a bump. Conclusion Damping plays a crucial role in real-world oscillatory systems. While underdamping allows oscillations to persist with decreasing amplitude, critical and overdamping eliminate oscillations more quickly. Understanding damping behavior is essential before analyzing more complex forced pendulum systems, which introduce external periodic forces.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#investigating-the-dynamics-of-a-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"","title":"Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#background-motivation","text":"A forced damped pendulum is a type of pendulum that experiences both friction (damping) and an external force that pushes it at regular intervals.

The amplitude decreases exponentially over time. Critically Damped ( \\( b^2 = \\frac{4m^2g}{L} \\) ) The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. This is often used in engineering to prevent overshooting (e.g., car suspension systems). Overdamped ( \\( b^2 > \\frac{4m^2g}{L} \\) ) The pendulum returns to equilibrium very slowly without oscillating. Energy loss is so strong that motion is heavily suppressed.","title":"Types of Damping"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#real-world-examples-of-damping","text":"A grandfather clock experiences slow air resistance and slight friction at the pivot, leading to a gradual decrease in amplitude if not wound regularly. Seismic dampers in buildings use overdamping principles to reduce vibrations during earthquakes. Automotive shock absorbers operate near critical damping to ensure smooth and stable motion after a bump.","title":"Real-World Examples of Damping"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#conclusion","text":"Damping plays a crucial role in real-world oscillatory systems. While underdamping allows oscillations to persist with decreasing amplitude, critical and overdamping eliminate oscillations more quickly. Understanding damping behavior is essential before analyzing more complex forced pendulum systems, which introduce external periodic forces.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/","text":"Problem 3","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"}]}
